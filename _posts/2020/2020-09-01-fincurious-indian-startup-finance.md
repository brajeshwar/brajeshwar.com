This is a short book and can easily be kept aside as a quick reference guide if you are running a Startup or starting one. This book does not teach you to be a financial expert but will help you keep you informed so you have an idea.

He has served as heads of many Startups such as <a href="https://near.co/">Near</a>, <a href="https://www.rentomojo.com/">Rentomojo</a>, and <a href="https://www.vedantu.com/">Vedantu</a>.
