<p>This is a short book and can easily be kept aside as a quick reference guide if you are running a Startup or starting one. This book does not teach you to be a financial expert but will help you keep you informed so you have an idea.</p>
<p>Rahul Saria is a Chartered Accountant. He has served as heads of many Startups such as <a href="https://near.co/">Near</a>, <a href="https://www.rentomojo.com/">Rentomojo</a>, and <a href="https://www.vedantu.com/">Vedantu</a>. He is currently the financial advisor to my Startup - <a href="https://valinor.earth">Valinor Earth</a>.</p>
<p>The book is written from the lens of starting and running a Startup in India. The book is short at less than 200 pages and you can finish it off in an hour or so.</p>
