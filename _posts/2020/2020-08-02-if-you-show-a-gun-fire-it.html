<p>I tend to be the super-excited founder who will talk and suggest doing things that would likely be years ahead of the current circumstances. My co-founder, and business partner for the last 8+ years, is the one who will help me glide down to earth, all the way to the very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first principle</a>.</p>
<p>A few days back, we were discussing the features of our new product for our Startup, <a href="https://valinor.earth">Valinor Earth</a>.</p>
<p>I was eager and was planning to demo some of the tools which were not ready. My co-founder insists that we are not prepared and would set off expectations that we may not be able to satisfy for a while. We might end up building a fancy tool without actually solving the customer’s problem.</p>
<p>As a normal human being, our customer will praise the tools and say good things – which, btw, is the least useful data for us to evaluate anything.</p>
<p>If you are going to show a gun, be ready to fire it. If we are showing the tools, then that tool should be made useful soon enough, if not immediately.</p>
<h2>Chekhov’s Gun</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun">Chekhov’s gun</a> is a dramatic principle stating that every element in a story must be necessary, and unnecessary details removed. A feature should not appear to make “false promises” by never coming into play.</p>
<p>If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, it absolutely must go off in the second or third chapter. If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn’t be hanging there.</p>
<p>One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn’t going to go off. It’s wrong to make promises you don’t mean to keep.</p>
<p>If you are going to show a tool or do a demo, be ready to use it and make sure it is relevant to the customer's needs.</p>
