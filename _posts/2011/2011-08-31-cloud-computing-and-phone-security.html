<p>A hilarious video of an Indian top brass talking crap about Mobile Phone Security and Cloud Computing. The subtitle is an actual .srt and not etched into the video.</p>
<p>This is my first subtitle done from scratch and may not be perfect. Feel free to contribute, improve on it, or re-produce your own version. A version of the video is included in the Subtitle source file. <a href="https://github.com/Brajeshwar/cloud-computing-and-phone-security">Fork it at Github</a>. Pull Requests are welcome.</p>
