<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdixon/status/148896542462455808">tweet</a> led to <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2011/desingineer-the-mythical-person-every-startups-are-looking-for/">an article</a>, which was fortunate to be on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3373702">Hackernews</a>. The above two-minute video is a cut of how my site experienced the traffic during it's initial first hour on Hackernews.</p>
<p>And yes, <a href="http://nsfw.in/">NSFW</a> is a service I run. It's been giving my site a run for it's traffic for quite a while.</p>
