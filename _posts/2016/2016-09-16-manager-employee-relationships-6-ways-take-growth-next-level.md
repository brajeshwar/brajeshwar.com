<p>As negative experiences with supervisors constitute the number one reasons employees leave companies, it is impossible to over-emphasize the importance of maintaining positive relations between managers and employees. Particularly important in small, Startup businesses where managers and employees tend to work extremely closely, building and maintaining strong relationships forms an important part of the company's foundation.</p>
<p>Here are six simple steps how managers can build mutual trust and respect with their employees, ensuring long-term dedication and retention. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Listen:</strong> Taking employees seriously shows respect and encourages communication. Opening the doors for communication dramatically improves the manager-employee relationship as employees know their voices are heard, their opinions matter, and they have a say in their jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Cut the Crap:</strong> Say what is true and needs to be said. Flattery, rumors, avoiding real issues, and other kinds of unnecessary word-play do not fool anyone.</li>
<li><strong>Appreciate:</strong> Take the time to thank employees for a job well done. Not only does this demonstrate attention and involvement, it inspires them to keep up good work, knowing that it does not go unnoticed.</li>
<li><strong>Work Together:</strong> Projects that result in more interaction also result in mentoring and growth on both sides. The obvious result is employee growth, but other benefits include building mutual respect and rapport, sharing the work-load.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Positive or negative, employees sometimes need an outside voice to give feedback before they can fully understand their performance. Managerial input offers them the chance to understand their work from a new and necessary perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Managers who provide purposeful opportunities for growth for their employees are investing in both the employee and the company -- a fact that is not lost on the employees.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the basic strategies of listening, honesty, being appreciative, purposeful mentoring, consistent feedback, and strategic growth opportunities sets up a positive atmosphere of communication and respect by demonstrating interest in the employees' productivity and their overall work experience. With time and commitment, building these traits can change the atmosphere of a workplace, securing dedicated employees and building strong and effective teams.</p>
