<p>Have you ever wondered and be amazed at other people's cool, geeky css selectors, attributes and surprised that you have missed many of them, specially those new CSS 3 thingy which is around for quite sometime? Well, I found a url that exactly does some explanation for what those geeky slectors mean, have a look at SelectORable, just paste your (or other people's for that matter) css and let it do the explanation.</p>
<p>While we are on this, you may also like to refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/" title="CSS 3 selectors">CSS 3 selectors</a> from <a href="http://www.w3.org" title="w3c website">w3c</a>'s website, and you may bookmark this <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html" title="css 2.1 draft">css 2.1 draft</a> too, very similar to the CSS2 but with a slightly better explanation.</p>
