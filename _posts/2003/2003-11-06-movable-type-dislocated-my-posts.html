<p>As this website move from an older server to a new server on (mt), many of my posts have been dislocated with their numeric values which are not same as previous entries. I have imported all entries but I found out that many links are not that what was before.</p>
<p>No entry numbers are corresponding to what they should point to. May be it is because I deleted a couple of entries from my blog, which are outdated and have no relevance to this world or the other world. So, if you came from any other link elsewhere and the entry on this website looks not-so-related, please search for the term.</p>
