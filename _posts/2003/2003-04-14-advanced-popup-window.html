<p>I had been using this advanced popup window in dreamweaver, and yes it has many advanced features. Center the popup window, flush it left, right, top, bottom, left-top, right-top, right-bottom and left-bottom, with or without all the browser tools and features, you can also launch it fullscreen. And till now it works on all OS and browsers, unless one of you report to me that it does not.</p>
