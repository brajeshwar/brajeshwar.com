<p><a href="http://www.mediatemple.net" title="mediatemple.net online" target="_blank">Mediatemple.net</a> got a new look with a stylish and techno-oriented design. Mediatemple is one of those best hosting service out there and I particularly like its prompt/fast reply and good customer support. Even if you have no interest for a web host at the moment, it would still be nice to just check out their new design, curved more towards the new media lingua, it would not be a misnomer to called that a real balanced layout.</p>
