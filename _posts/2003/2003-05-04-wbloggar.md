<p>w.bloggar have released its latest version, 3.01 and included a new feature which I was waiting for quite sometime, the extended entry for movable type blog. "Support to the "Extended Entry" field on MovableType blogs thru the special tags , is a good idea to add it as Custom Tag if you often use the "Extended Entry". Though it sports many other plug-ins like winamp, windows media player 9 and the like, which are OT for flash bloggers, on the overall score this tool is a nifty cool tool, you will never need to open movable type interface to blog. Read more details about w.bloggar at <a href="http://wbloggar.com/" target="_blank">http://wbloggar.com/</a> and you may download the latest built from the site too. More importantly this tool is a freeware.</p>
