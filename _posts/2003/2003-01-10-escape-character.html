<p>I was using escape character for dynamic text field for some of my contents for a project and instead of looking around for characters and their escaped character values, I just did a simple thing using flash itself, check it out yourself and if you like it, <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/opensource/escape/" target="_self">click here</a> to view it online, or download just the <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/opensource/escape/escape.swf" target="_self">.swf</a> format / <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/opensource/escape/escape.zip" target="_self">zip</a> format, a <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/opensource/escape/escape.exe" target="_self">windows projector</a> format or a <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/opensource/escape/escape.hqx" target="_self">Mac projector</a> format. Some features like minimize and close may not work on all platform while the real functionality still works, the minimize and close functions are for windows projector only. And don't blame for the size of the project, they are heavy as they are projectors, Windows projector is about 1 MB and the Mac projector is about 1.5 MB, windows projector was done using <a href="http://www.multidmedia.com/" target="_blank">Flash Studio Pro 1.74</a>.</p>
