<p>So, all those heavy demand for the come back of "Scale and Rotate" is fruitful, it is back in its full glory. The only thing is that it does not have a shortcut, well if you were so use to that Ctrl+Alt+S in Flash MX, then just re-assign the keyboard shortcut to it for your editing pleasure.</p>
