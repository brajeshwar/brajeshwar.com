<p>Yes, I will be going offline for sometime very soon because of <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/" title="Media Temple web hosting">(mt)</a>, it is because I am upgrading to their new server with multiple databases. They are offering upto 5 database for my (ss) pro option of hosting on their shared server. You can see their <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/services/webhosting/ss/linux-standard/compare.php" title="shared server linux comparison on media temple">comparison chart</a> for the same. Also notice the change on their site. I am talking with their support to have a seamless changeover to the new server but just in case you want to hunt for something that you saw on my site, all blogs contents have been mirrored on <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.net/" title="Brajeshwar.net">brajeshwar.net</a>. Well, this mirror version of my site is hosted by <a href="http://www.mediumcube.com/" title="medium cube web hosting">mediumcube.com</a> and I am finding that they are also good with cool wooping features, prompt support.</p>
