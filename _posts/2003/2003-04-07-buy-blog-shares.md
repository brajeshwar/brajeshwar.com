<p>I saw this at <a href="http://www.quasimondo.com/" title="Quasimondo">quasimondo/</a>, something called <a href="http://www.blogshares.com">blogshares</a>. A place where you go and buy shares of blogs virtually. You can claim your own blog if they are listed there. <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http://www.brajeshwar.com/">Click here</a> to check that out and do some blog trading.</p>
