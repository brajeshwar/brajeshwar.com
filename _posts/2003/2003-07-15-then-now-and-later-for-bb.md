<p>It would be worth keeping a watch over BB's <a href="http://www.billybussey.com" target="_blank">website</a>, some cool intro in 3D and 3D effects punctuated across the site. Words are already spreading across the designer's community of the new version being released very soon. I suggest watching the site on the highband option.</p>
