<p>It seem almost every Flash Developers and Designers alike have a blog of their own, the last and prominent entry being that of <a href="http://www.asvguy.com/" title="Burak Kalayci">Burak Kalayci</a>, rather the Actionscript Viewer Guy. On a rather serious note, don't you really have a blog?</p>
