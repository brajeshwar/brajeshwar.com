<p>I had this in mind long back and had communicated with the people at Macromedia for quite sometime, I had even started a thread on an India centric (though globally accessible) forum but the response was lack-luster so it died out eventually. I had about two authentic users of Flash ready for the plunge but I need more than that, I am looking for a minimum of 20+ Flash users.</p>
