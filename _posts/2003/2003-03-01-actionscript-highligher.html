<p>Ah! I discovered this damn too late. I am trying to use Actionscript highligher, and yes an easy one to implement at that and <a href="http://www.shockwave-india.com/blog/" target="_blank">Arul</a> was kind enough to point me to the right url for my requirement, AS highlighter for PHP (an ASP version is also available there). There is also a good one <a href="http://www.beautifier.org/" target="_blank">beautifier</a>.</p>
<p>The strange finding I got was a credit to my site (if I am not wrong), though the spelling was mispelled "Thanks to breshjar.com for MX Functions Listing". Well, I thought nobody was interested in my listings which I used it mainly for my favorite text editor. I do not have any update to that at the moment save for the old one which I will update may be by the end of March with all other missing ones, including Flash Communication Server MX server side and client side scripts. If you wish to get the old version you may mail me instead at the moment.<br />
Hmm, this is a nice script but instead of generating the font tags with the colors inside the php file, what about exporting them out to an outside single CSS so that you can change them just in case in future and have it uniformly changed everywhere. That should be cool. Just a thought.</p>
