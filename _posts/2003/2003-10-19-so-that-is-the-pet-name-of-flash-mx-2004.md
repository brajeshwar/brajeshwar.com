<p>Like most of you, I went to Edwin Wong's Web services without components via <a href="http://www.mediasparkles.com/" title="media sparkles">Vera</a>. No, nothing about that but I noticed something, the petname for Flash MX 2004, "F04", that is rather short and sounds fine. If I can remember, this title of "F04" atleast missed the discussion that happen a couple weeks ago about the short name for Flash MX 2004.<br />
Have a nice Sunday.<br />
(p.s. Sorry that two of my old post spit out yesterday on all aggregators, I was just changing some of the "titles" to make the pages a valid xhtml 1.0 transitional. So, I learnt something, leave the title alone and do not disturb the aggregators.)</p>
