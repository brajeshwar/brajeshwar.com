<p>I was reading Peter's blog and saw a link to one of the clipping from FFNYC 2003, look at the clipping at first, second and the third. It is sorta "Flashed" Powerpoint. While you are there, take a look at Breeze Live demo showing its screen sharing and powerpoint slide sharing capability on this clipping.</p>
