<p>With the release of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/" target="_blank">contribute 2.0</a>, Macromedia came with something else cool called the "Flash Paper". At current the editing of Flash Paper is supported only on Windows 2000/XP though it will play under any platform which have Flash Player 6.0 and above plug-in. Flash paper can be generated from any application that can print. Read more details about Flash paper <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/productinfo/flashpaper/" target="_blank">here</a>. Mike Chambers seem to have a bit more detail about the same, click here to read further.</p>
