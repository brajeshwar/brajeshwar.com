<p>I am using "w.bloggar (w.bloggar)":http://wbloggar.com v3.00 for blogging straight from my desktop. Everything else is cool and can "Post and Publish" on Blogger, b2, MovableType, Nucleus, BigBlogTool, BlogWorks XML Blogalia and Drupal blogs. But the only thing that I find it lacking is that of the ability to do the *Extended Entry* for Movable type. Anybody have any idea, please suggest me an alternative tool or a way to add inside w.blogger. That would be damn too great.</p>
