<p>This is likely a bug with one of the famous desktop blog publishing software, <a href="http://www.zempt.com/" title="zempt">Zempt 0.3</a>, every time I do an editing, like changing spellings or whatever editing of an already posted "post", it adds another entry in my archive though the display on the blog is fine. I realize this when I saw that the previous and next in the entries have the same title while I was still on the same page. If you look at <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/000155.php">http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/000155.php</a> and <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/000154.php">http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/000154.php</a>, they are the same entry with two individual archives created.<br />
But I will still be using this tool as there is no other tool as easy to use and cool as this yet. I had though used <a href="http://www.bloggar.com" title="w.bloggar">w.bloggar</a> for quite sometime, I still have no grudge against that too. Well it is still in use on my desktop when I am publishing from there. Otherwise, both tools are cool desktop blog publishing tools.</p>
