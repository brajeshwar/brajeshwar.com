<p><a href="http://www.swfoo.com/">Dave Yang</a>, recently had some issues with <a href="http://buraks.com/asv/">Actionscript Viewer 4.0</a> where some individual pretending to be Dave Yang, by changing his email account to his/her Hotmail email and asking for the software/key, read more about the story here.<br />
I have a similar story where another person was asking me to ....., better read the mail below </p>
<p><span class="codeRed">Hi</span>,<br />
