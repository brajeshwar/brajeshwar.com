<p>Nice use of Flash Video, <a href="http://www.ask-crystal.com/" title="Ask Crystal">Ask Crystal</a>; ask something and get it answered. You can repeat the same question and still get different answers. The application is intelligently executed with load queue management of the swf videos.</p>
<p>Looking at the "Most asked questions", I am sure girls use this a lot more than boys. Those questions are definitely asked mostly by the fairer sex;</p>
<p>* Should I end my relationship?<br />
* Can you help me?<br />
* Am I too fat?<br />
* How can I find a partner?<br />
* Am I normal?<br />
* Do you know Oprah?<br />
* Can I change my boyfriend?</p>
