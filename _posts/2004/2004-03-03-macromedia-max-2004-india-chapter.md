<p>The Macromedia MAX 2004, India Chapter (<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/ap/events/max2004_india.html" title="Macromedia MAX 2004, Details">view details</a>) kicks off in Bangalore today.<br />
Mike Downey and James Talbot are here in India for the event and along with Titu (I am sure he does not need an introduction to the Indian Developers) completed the speakers list.<br />
James Talbot's session on "Component Oriented Development with Macromedia Flash MX 2004" really made it look/feel so easy to develop a component. I, myself, am not really a big fan of Component Development but I think things gonna change.<br />
It was cool, I was sitting around a corner with the laptop and power point given to me (thanks to the guys at Macromedia, Mumbai for arranging those chair/table/powercord for me), I was lucky to answer lotta questions from the attendants.<br />
[Update : The Macromedia MAX, New Delhi Chapter also went well, you can view some of the Photographs of the same.]</p>
