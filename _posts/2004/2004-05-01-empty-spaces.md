excerpt: The Wanderer is Philippe Wittenbergh, image poet, wanderer, web designer.
  He is currently living in the eastern part of the world, timezones ahead of most
  people, surrounded by tea fields, a cat, a partner and some more. He loves Jazz,
  avantguarde music and books, fine wine and some beers should not be forgotten.
