<p>Indian Flash Developers and Designers alike will for the first time have a chance to flaunt their designing and development skill in Flash. And yes, the winning entries will get awards worth more than INR 3,40,000/-.<br />
There are separate categories for designers (Flash graphics, animation, and presentations) and developers (Rich Internet Applications). The contest will be judged by technical experts from Macromedia, eminent members of the community, and individuals via online voting. FlashClash is open only to Indian residents, and participation is completely free.<br />
Read the details and Register for the clash here.<br />
[<span class="codeRed">Update : Rules for the competition</span><br />
(a) You can use the trial version of the software to participate in the competition.<br />
(b) You are allowed to use third party tools like Screenweaver MX, Flash Studio Pro etcetera along with Flash.]</p>
<p><strong>Result : The result and online opinion will soon be posted on the contest site, the result is delayed mostly because some of the entries are not accompanied by enough information for the judges to judge and the organizers have been contacting them for proper, fair decision. Hang on for about a week and you will start seeing the result (information as on Thursday, 15th April, 2004).</strong></p>
