<p>Recently, there was some uproar about a new Open Source AS2 Compiler. After few testing and playing around with the same, it seems an order of magnitude faster than what we have with Flash MX 2004. Even on a lower end slow machine, there is an estimate 5-10 times faster. Looks like a pointer for the next version of Flash, 8Ball, to gear up and take notice.</p>
