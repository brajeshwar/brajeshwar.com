<p>I am not giving you an answer but looking more for informations on preparing oneself for disaster as the one that happen sometime ago with a site that I was running; <a href="http://indiammug.com/" title="IndiaMMUG">India's Macromedia User Group</a>. The site was attacked and defaced by F3PN, more details.<br />
[Sorry to those who were trying to access a tutorial and saw a black screen instead, everything is resolved now. And thanks for mailing me about the same.]</p>
