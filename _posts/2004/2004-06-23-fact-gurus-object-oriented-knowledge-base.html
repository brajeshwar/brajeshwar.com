The "subjects are arranged in a hierarchy - each subject "is a" kind of the subject above it. You can also view the subjects in alphabetical order or as a graph. If you click on a subject in the hierarchy, you will see facts about that subject appear in this pane. From there you can follow links to other subject. You can compare a subject and its siblings, or all the children of a subject by clicking on the Compare tab."</p>
