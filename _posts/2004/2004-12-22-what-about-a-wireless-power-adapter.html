excerpt: I think even this should not be that far, I saw something at D-link, which
  is an approach towards the same where it supplies power (low, below +5v) to wireless
  devices. It will be cool if the whole power supply to a NoteBook can be totally
  wireless.

<p>I have recently wi-fi-ed my home; and the office, which we are trying slowly to have a NoteBook culture. Not just the wireless connection, but the mice are now wireless and the only thing left now is of a wireless power supply. I think even this should not be that far, I saw something at D-link, which is an approach towards the same where it supplies power (low, below +5v) to wireless devices (have forgotten the link to the actual product). It will be cool if the whole power supply to a NoteBook can be totally wireless.</p>
