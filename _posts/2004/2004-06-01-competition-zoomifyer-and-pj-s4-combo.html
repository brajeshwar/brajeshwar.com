<p>Here is the main competition to win 20 licenses of Zoomifyer and 3 combo packs of PJ and Supreme4. I am sorry that this competition is open mainly for Indian developers and I am taking advantage of this site to lead to the details on the <a href="http://indiammug.com/" title="India's Macromedia User Group">India's Macromedia User Group</a>, visit the  direct link.</p>
