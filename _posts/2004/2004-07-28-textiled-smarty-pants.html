excerpt: It may be noted that SmartyPants can work in conjunction with Brad Choate's
  MT-Textile plug-in. MT-Textile is a port of Dean Allen's original Textile project
  to Perl and Movable Type. MT-Textile by itself only translates Textile markup to
  HTML. However, if SmartyPants is also installed, MT-Textile will call on SmartyPants
  to educate quotes, dashes, and ellipses, automatically. Using SmartyPants in conjunction
  with MT-Textile requires no modifications to your Movable Type templates.

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/" title="SmartyPants">SmartyPants</a> is a free web publishing plug-in for Movable Type that easily translates plain ASCII punctuation characters into smart typographic punctuation HTML entities. </p>
<p>It may be noted that SmartyPants can work in conjunction with <a href="http://bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php" title="MT-Textile plug-in">Brad Choate's MT-Textile plug-in</a>.

<p>Using SmartyPants in conjunction with MT-Textile requires no modifications to your Movable Type templates. I had mine to automatically use Textile 2 for "<strong>Default Text Formatting for new entries</strong>", it also became automatically available on the desktop blog publishing software, <a href="http://zempt.com/" title="zempt">Zempt</a> which I am using. Go to your MT Weblog Config > Preference and select <strong>Textile 2</strong> in the "Specifies the default Text Formatting option when creating a new entry".</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES</strong></p>
<p>With the release of MT 3.1, you have another option of text formating, mark down. Mark Down can be used in conjunction with Smarty Pants.</p>
