<p>A project was recently completed where AS2 was used to publish to Flash player 6,0,21,0 and above. One of the requirement was to use the AS1 Broadcaster from Peter Hall and avoid EventDispatcher. And being a person good to the Flash Community (ahem! atleast I try my best) I want to release that to public if anybody wishes to use the same but in AS2 version. Thanks to Peter Hall and Darshan for their permission and help respectively.</p>
