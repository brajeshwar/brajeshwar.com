<p>For the first time, <a href="http://www.redbullflugtagportland.com/" title="Flugtag">Flugtag</a> will also be broadcast live over the Internet. Utilizing the interactive features of Flash Video and streaming through the Flash Video Streaming Service powered by <a href="http://www.VitalStream.com" title="VitalStream">VitalStream</a>, viewers will be able to switch between camera angles of the event in real time. They will also be able to select from amongst a number of prerecorded video vignettes about the teams and the competitors. After the event, the video will be archived and available on-demand.<br />
This will be the first large-scale implementation of the just-announced Live version of the Flash Video Streaming Service, powered by VitalStream.<br />
