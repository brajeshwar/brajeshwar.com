<p><a href="http://www.patrickjansen.net/components/" title="PJ and Supreme4 collections">PJ and Supreme4 collections</a> of Flash Text Effects, which were available as SWFX/WildFX plugins, are now available as Macromedia Flash MX (MX / 2004 / 2004 professional) Component collections. Drag & drop effects from the component panel, set text; as easy as that. All effects have customizable parameters. They can now be adjusted to your liking without any limitations. PJ and Supreme 4 collections together contain over 150 original effects.<br />
I am thinking of two winning options<br />
(a) Three lucky individuals can win 3 Power pack (PJ+Supreme4)<br />
or<br />
(b) 5 licenses of choice for either PJ or Supreme4 for the first 5<br />
If the demand is good, Mr. <a href="http://www.patrickjansen.net/" title="Patrick Jansen">Patrick Jansen</a> is ready to give us more.<br />
I am yet to come up with an idea for the competition, while I am on it, you can go to the <a href="http://www.patrickjansen.net/components/" title="PJ and Supreme4 collections">Component's site</a> and view the details. Come back to my blog later to know what you have to do to win the same (may be I will post another message so that all aggregators and newsreader also picks up the same).</p>
