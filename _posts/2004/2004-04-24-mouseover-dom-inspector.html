<p>A very good friend of mine, infact my 'CSS' role model, sent me this link of a bookmarklet on <a href="http://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/modi.html" title="mouseover DOM inspector">Mouseover DOM Inspector</a>. "This favelet allows you to view the properties of any HTML element on a page simply by mousing over the element. The element will be given a gray background, and a DIV element that trails the mouse cursor will contain the element type along with all of the specified attributes of the element."</p>
