<p>I am on the hunt for a good if not the best Flash UI Designer to re-design our corporate site (as it is being launched in a big way very soon, registered as a private limited company). So, please comment here or use the contact form to contact me with your hourly rate in either (US$, GBP, INR or EURO). The scripting part will be taken care of either by me or by our internal team, so you can relax on that front. The re-design is for the site, <a href="http://oinam.com/" title="Oinam Software">Oinam Software</a>. We haven't had that much of time to groom some good designers yet, so we are a bit weak in this section currently but we will cap that gap more sooner than you can imagine.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Please include links to your works, profile, samples!]</p>
