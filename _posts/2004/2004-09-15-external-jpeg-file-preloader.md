<p>Due to popular demands and complaints from many MM forum users when my previous external JPEG preloader went offline, I am bringing back the "external JPEG preloader (external JPEG preloader)":http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/preloadjpg/ with a new improvised script. I wasn't sure if people still liked that preloader, so, I am sorry as most of the files went offline while changing web host. You can download the same "w/o image (without image)":http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/preloadjpg/preloadjpgwoimage.zip (53 kb) or "with image (with image)":http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/preloadjpg/preloadjpg.zip (350 kb).</p>
<p>Please note that there is no preloader for the main movie, so you may need to wait for the 17kb main movie on a slow connection. Take note that the improvement is mainly in the fact that the previous image remains shown while the next image is preloaded.</p>
