<p>It had been quite sometime since I got the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140185437/102-9410413-2486566?v=glance" title="Malgudi Days">Malgudi Days</a> by RK Narayan, as a complimentary copy for my Membership at <a href="http://crossword.co.in/" title="CrossWord">CrossWord</a>. I never took much interest in reading it whole heartedly, but then I started reading the short stories whenever I had some free times. I began to enjoy by around the second and the third story. The stories took me back to my school days when I read short stories that were part of our English Course. Nice stories, good read.</p>
