<p>Macromedia MAX 2004-India, "the premier conference for developers & designers using macromedia products", is perhaps the first in India to be given the status of something like MAX and I am all delighted that things are shaping up well for Flash enthusiast in India. But the bummer this time is that it is being just targetted at the capital city, New Delhi and Bangalore.<br />
At Macromedia MAX 2004-India, you'll have access to technical sessions that cover everything from basic web development to the most advanced techniques for building Rich Internet Applications. You'll meet Macromedia engineers, industry experts, and developers, and you'll be among the first to see presentations and demos of new technologies for architecting the expanding Internet experience.</p>
