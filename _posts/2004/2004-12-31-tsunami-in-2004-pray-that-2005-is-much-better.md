<p><?php ImgBlog("blogobabble/blogaid.gif", 1, "Pledge for the Tsunami Victims", "http://www.blogaid.org.uk/");?>Many people (view listing) have pledged their site earnings to support the earthquake and tsunami appeal. If you also wish to pledge for the Tsunami Victims, please visit BlogAid.</p>
<p>The 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the western-most portion of Indonesia's northern Sumatra Island early on Sunday, 26th December, 2004.</p>
<p>[<em>Note: I just wish that the site proof-read the article atleast for the facts and figures; at the time of writing this article, BlogAid wrongly stated that the incident happened on 26th November, 2004 but it happened on 26th December, 2004.</em>]</p>
