excerpt: A Simulation using Captivate to teach how to use Shared Library Assets across
  multiple SWFs in Flash MX and above.

<p>Macromedia recently released <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/captivate/" title="Macromedia Captivate">Captivate</a>, and here is my first attempt in creating something out of it. The outcome is not that clean or professional but I think it is enough to get the message across. A Simulation using Captivate to teach how to use Shared Library Assets across multiple SWFs in Flash MX and above.</p>
<p>* View the <a href="http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/sharedassets/captivate.html" title="Captivate Simulation">Captivate Simulation</a> (3MB)<br />
* View the working <a href="http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/sharedassets/">Demo</a><br />
* Download the <a href="http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/sharedassets/sharedassets.zip" title="Download Demo File">Demo File</a></p>
<p>You can download the <a href="http://downloads.brajeshwar.com/flashmx/sharedassets/sharedassets.swf" title="Captivated File">captivated SWF file</a> to view it offline. I have not used audio to save some bytes but the simulation is cool enough to explain things in itself. I suggest downloading all of them.</p>
