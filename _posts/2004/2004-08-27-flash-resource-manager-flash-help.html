<p>There is a huge difference being a developer and being an instructor. Being a developer, you can concentrate on only the area where you are dealing with, good at and what is needed. As a developer, I never needed to use behaviors in Flash MX 2004. But then as an instructor, I have to teach those techniques too. Today, I was trying to use XMLConnector with bahavior and the component inspector, well, I was caught by surprise by the difficulty I have in getting myself used to the mechanism. Unable to get around to the issue fast enough, I then tried to open up the Flash help, unfortunately the Help do not have the XMLConnector documents (am I missing something here); it was there before the updater.<br />
Lesson learnt, have Flash Resource Manager from Mike Chambers handy. The docs are there!</p>
