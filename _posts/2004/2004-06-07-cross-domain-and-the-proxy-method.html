<p>Here the documentation from Macromedia <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/" title="macromedia livedocs">Livedocs</a> on <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/mx2004/main/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=Flash_MX_2004_Documentation&file=10_ext16.htm" title="Cross Domain Data Loading">Cross Domain Data Loading</a>, Moock has done a good <a href="http://www.moock.org/asdg/technotes/crossDomainPolicyFiles/" title="cross domain xml example">explanation</a> about the same. But there are times when an unusual implementation can help you in a good way. Aral has a good example of using server side script to act as a proxy between Flash and server side script	to get around the sandbox security limitation (which stops Flash from directly accessing data on other domains.)</p>
