<p>Reading a series of post on "Flashlounge and a few on Flashcoders (Flashlounge and a few on Flashcoders):"http://chattyfig.figleaf.com/, it seems every company is looking for *good* Flash Actionscript Developers. This is indeed a very good news. People are beginning to realize that they can depend on Flash for some kick ass applications. What else can I say but just enjoy and savor the nice things happening around *Flash*.</p>
<p>After seeing the post on Flashlounge, I would not be wrong to conclude that India too have many Flash Designers and Developers which are not in the limelight of the community and for some reason prefer to remain that way. It seems to look good all around for Flashers, let me hope that the future will hold much much better things for all us, who live and swear by this software (so far).</p>
