<p>I had been hunting around for a software that is either free or cheap (under $20); unluckily, I could not find one good enough for the task. But then I just saw that <a href="http://www.picasa.com/" title="Picasa">Picasa</a> have an option to reduce Red Eye from Digital Photographs besides the other kick-ass options from a <strong>free</strong> Photograph Album Collection/Maintenance software. And let me tell you, the Red Eye Reduction tool of Picasa is way too cool and works great.</p>
<p><strong>From <a href="http://www.picasa.com/" title="Picasa">Picasa</a>'s website</strong>:</p>
<p>* Find all your photos - and make photo albums, quickly and easily.<br />
* Edit with ease - Crop, reduce red-eye, and enhance with one quick click.<br />
* Print at home - No mistakes. No waiting. No hassles. Just beauty.<br />
* Share photos online - via email or Picasa's Hello technology.<br />
* Make slide shows - set to your own MP3 music files and much more ...</p>
<p>Download Picasa and others from the <a href="http://www.google.com/downloads/" title="Google Downloads">Google downloads</a>.<br />
