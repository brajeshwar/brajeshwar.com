<p>"<a href="http://ootips.org/hungarian-notation.html" title="Hungarian Notation">Hungarian Notation</a> is a naming convention invented by Charles Simonyi from Microsoft. Here, one writes things like m_nSize, hwndParent and lpszFile."</p>
<p>During the olden days of ActionScript 1.0, it was rather a good practice, discipline a developer maintains, and a personal choice that helps to maintain consistency. But with ActionScript 2.0 which is now Strict Typed; Hungarian Notation would have no purpose literally. Nonthless, it can still be used consistently and appropriately according to personal development habit, choice. Pick your decision!</p>
