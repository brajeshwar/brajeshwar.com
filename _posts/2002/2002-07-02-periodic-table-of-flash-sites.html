<p>I found some referer on my web log from <a href="http://www.flazoom.com/" title="flashzoom">Flashzoom</a> and so I went there to see if I could see my site anywhere being linked. But I could not find one, after searching and roaming around a bit, I saw the 'periodic table of flash' where my site 'Br' was included in the table.</p>
