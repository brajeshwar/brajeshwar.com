<p>I was visiting movable type yesterday and just today I saw their new version of the both the application MT 2.2 and the website. Interested parties and those using MT can check the new happening on <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">movabletype.org</a>. Oh Boy, I am not changing to MT at this moment, have little time to get used to something else, I will still be using <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">blogger</a> along with <a href="http://blogkomm.com/">blogkomm</a> for my comments for the days to come.</p>
