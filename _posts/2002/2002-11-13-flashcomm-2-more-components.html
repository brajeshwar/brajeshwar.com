<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashcom/download/components/" target="_blank">Flashcomm Components</a>, they have been upadated and 2 more components (15th Component : VideoPlayback and the 16th : VideoRecord) have been added. Go get your <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashcom/download/components/" target="_blank">FREE download</a> today. Thanks to <a href="http://samuelwan.com/information/" target="_blank">Sam</a> for the quick info.<br />
Remember to read the documentation of the 2 new components in the PDF that is enclosed with the communication components package. It is also learnt that the "SimpleConnect" component no longer has a memory leak on the client-side; previously, the memory leak occurred if you typed faster than 1 character every 10 milliseconds. And no more problem of those people asking how can you have more than one AVPresence component instances in a single application without having to set the property for each instance of the AVPresence,<br />
As promised by Peldi in one of the flashcomm mailing list, "application.asc" and "framework.asc files" have been modified to allow garbage collection for applications using components. Enjoy !</p>
