<p><a href="http://www.cybersage.com/firefly.asp" target="_blank">Firefly for Flash</a> is a professional suite of components that let you manage data within Flash MX applications. Visual property editors unique to Firefly make writing ActionScript to manage data a thing of the past. Firefly's architecture includes an extensive API that gives developers total control over managing data. Firefly Plug-ins currently available include XML, Remoting and SQL Server. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cybersage.com/flashdoc.asp" target="_blank">FlashDoc</a> takes the pain out of creating ActionScript documentation for Flash MX components. FlashDoc parses comment tags in your ActionScript to generate properly formatted Flash MX documentation. A few lines of ActionScript comments is all it takes to create professional Flash documentation. FlashDoc is an absolute must for anyone writing ActionScript code in Flash MX.</p>
