<p>There was some discussion on the Macromedia Flash Forum about Full screen from the page itself. I just thought I will share that too here. You may alternatively have the click to be onLoad of the Body so that the browser goes fullscreen on load itself.<br />
Have the folllowing Javascript</p>
<pre>function fullscreen(){
 var hdiff;
 window.moveTo(-4,-4);
 window.resizeTo(screen.width,screen.height);
 hdiff=window.screenTop;
 window.moveTo(-6,-hdiff-7);
 window.resizeTo(screen.width+13,screen.height+hdiff+35)
}</pre>
<p>and on your link put a @href=""javascript:fullscreen();"@</p>
