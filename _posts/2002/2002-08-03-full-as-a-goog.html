<p>You must have seen RSS feeds of most of the popular blogs using flash interface and you know, it's slow (I have to say this !) if you want a quickie of most of the blogs, you can visit <a href="http://fullasagoog.com/">fullasagoog</a> to view them, read them. You can suggest him some new blog if you see that your favorite is missing.</p>
