<p>I don't use Windows, so I had totally brushed aside the offer of 4 free Professional licenses of WinAutomation. However, I felt it should be useful to Windows users who visit my site. So, here you go -- stand a chance to win a WinAutomation license Professional Edition (I've got 4 licenses to give away).</p>
<p><strong>What do you need to do?</strong></p>
<p>Just comment on how you will use <a href="http://www.winautomation.com/">WinAutomation</a> to help you in your daily Windows Computing.</p>
