<p>I once attended a Breeze Live Presentation on Flashcom. Before the actual presentation started, there was a Questionnaire, the options was about ones expertise level in Flash Communication Server (a) I am a Newbie (b) I have used Flashcom ==(c)== I am an expert (d) I am Brian Lesser (I actually don't recollect the exact wordings of a, b and c but I am certain about that "d" there). It simply means, Brian Lesser is one of that guy who is one of the best Flashcom Developer. </p>
<p>The much anticipated Flash Communication Server book "Programming Flash Communication Server (Programming Flash Communication Server)":http://flash-communications.net/ is expected to be released around the end of February, 2005. The book is co-authored by "Brian Lesser ()":http://www.ryerson.ca/%7Eblesser/, "Giacomo (Peldi) Guilizzoni ()":http://www.peldi.com/blog/, "Robert Reinhardt ()":http://www.flashsupport.com/, "Justin Watkins ()":http://www.justin-watkins.com/ and "Joey Lott ()":http://www.person13.com/</p>
<p>I shouldn't be saying anything beyond this at this time at this moment, but to suggest to get the book as soon as it is released. I will do my full review when it goes out in the market. Oh! yes, watch "O'Reilly (O'Reilly)":http://www.oreilly.com/ for some chapter(s) release from the book anytime (I don't know the exact time though).</p>
<p>"Pre-Order at O'Reilly (Pre-Order at O'Reilly)":http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progflashcs/</p>
