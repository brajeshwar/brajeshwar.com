<p>Today "Wired.com (Wired.com)":http://www.wired.com/ had an article "Hackers Tilt PowerBook for Tricks (Hackers Tilt PowerBook for Tricks)":http://wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66936,00.html, a rather entertaining article to read. The article eventually makes you sit up and read through the finer lines, think over on how things are shaping around the world we live in.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the article states, "Enterprising hackers have discovered that because the new motion sensor returns reasonably accurate measurements to Mac OS X, it can be used to do some cool tricks, from realigning an image in a window so it always points up, no matter what angle you hold the laptop at, to controlling what's playing in iTunes -- rock the machine backward to go to the next track, forward to play the previous one."</p>
<p>Also, read through "Amit Singh (About Amit Singh)":http://www.kernelthread.com/about/'s AMS Article, "The PowerBook Sudden Motion Sensor (The PowerBook Sudden Motion Sensor)":http://www.kernelthread.com/software/ams/.</p>
