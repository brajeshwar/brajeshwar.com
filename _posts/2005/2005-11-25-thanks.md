<p>I never realize the importance of "ThanksGiving (ThanksGiving)":http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=thanksgiving until I experience one myself. I really wanted to write this article on my *personal blog* but then to push it home, I am having it here as I am targetting more of the technical peoples to extend my virtual *Thanks*.</p>
<p>I am somewhere in South Pasadena for over a week, living with a family, dining every day with them, family shopping for clothes, vegetables and everything else in between, watching movies, mixing both business dinners with family/friend getting-to-know meetings. Experiencing "Sushi (Sushi)":http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=define%3Asushi&btnG=Google+Search yet again. I wasn't that comfortable eating it during my last visit in June this year but now I am beginning to like it. I was surprised when the chief chef at *Yoshida* recognized me with a __Hello, Long Time; No See__. Tasted the foods at a Thai Temple (I have forgotten where it was). They have something called "Green Card Lottery"; yes, you can get Green Card through Lottery. Well, they say America is more about foods, merry-making, enjoyment, nice cars, vacations and all the other good stuffs and I am beginning to believe that. The weather in this part of the state is really cool, extremely nice and is really soothing to a person coming from the humid warm weather of Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>On this ThanksGiving day, the family had been frantically piling up cold drinks, preparing foods since early morning to entertain a good amount of guest. The meat balls are tasty, the smell of the huge Turkey had been tempting my taste-buds ever since it puffs out its first aroma.</p>
<p>I would really like to thank many people, the organizations from which I have learnt a lot, gained a lot. And here is sincere effort to list a few though not the full list which will rather be endless;</p>
