<p>Our team at Oinam Software launched our "blog (Oinam Software Blog)":http://blog.oinam.com/ on its "birthday (Oinam Blog)":http://blog.oinam.com/archives/2005/08/oinam-blog/ (August 21). We have posted our first article, "Flash 8 File Upload Download (Flash 8 File Upload Download)":http://blog.oinam.com/archives/2005/08/flash-8-file-upload-download/. The blog is under progressive development, so enjoy the beauty. ;-)</p>
<p>The "Flash 8 Player File Upload Download example (Flash 8 Player File Upload Download example)":http://blog.oinam.com/archives/2005/08/flash-8-file-upload-download/ includes an Express Install, please test that out too beside the usual spice of Preview-before-Download, multiple file uploads. The current example is custom set to allow only 100Kb of each file uploaded and a restriction of only Image FileTypes. Look at the ColdFusion! ColdFusion Rocks.
