excerpt: We are not sure at whose hand are we trusting our technology upon. Our team
  could do nothing but to laugh off. We are planning on giving our real e-mail which
  we give to other marketing people who ask for the same, "my personal e-mail (Personal
  e-mail)":mailto:brajeshwar@papernapkin.net or our "company's e-mail(Company's E-mail)":mailto:oinam@papernapkin.net.

<p>Very recently, as our company moved in to a bigger office, we went for an Internet connection from the premier Internet Service Provider in India, VSNL or the "Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited)":http://www.vsnl.com/. Doing so, one of their requirement for the registration was my mail ID which I gave trusting them as one of those 'technical-advanced-techies-helping-us'. Unfortunately, ever since then, I am flooded with virus infected e-mails which are all from the different employees of "VSNL (Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited)":http://www.vsnl.com/.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, they are caught by our Anti-Virus which we are very serious about. Now, we are not sure at whose hand are we trusting our technology upon. Our team could do nothing but to laugh off. We are planning on giving our real e-mail which we give to other marketing people who ask for the same, "my personal e-mail (Personal e-mail)":mailto:brajeshwar@papernapkin.net or our "company's e-mail(Company's E-mail)":mailto:oinam@papernapkin.net.</p>
