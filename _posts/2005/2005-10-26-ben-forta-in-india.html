<p>"Ben Forta (Ben Forta)":http://www.forta.com/ is likely to be in India during the India MAX 2005, Bangalore Chapter! I am sure the ColdFusion Developers in India have a good reason to rejoice and perhaps plan their trip to Bangalore during early to mid December (I don't know if "Macromedia (Macromedia)":http://www.macromedia.com/ have fixed the dates yet!).</p>
