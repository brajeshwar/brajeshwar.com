<p>The much anticipated 6th book of "J.K. Rowling (J.K. Rowling)":http://www.jkrowling.com/, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was released on July 16, 2005. The release was synchronized all across the globe, including India. I got my copy on the very first day!</p>
<p>We have a quite a few people really into Harry Potter in our development team. In the past coupla days, our discussions have been infiltrated by Hogwarts, Dumbledore, the Quiditch game and even the books taught during the seven years at Hogwarts. Those who are in the discussion but not into Harry Potter are now asking for the initial 5 books so that they can come in for the discussions.</p>
<p>Next year, Harry Potter will be finishing Hogwarts and legally an adult (17 is the legal year in the world of wizards). We will be looking forward to the next book with much anticipation. Let us see how things turn out in the final fight of Good-over-Evil. He-who-must-not-be-named will definitely be killed or something like that but how?</p>
<p>In this 6th book;<br />
__Who is the Half-Blood Prince?__<br />
__Who is the other important person that got killed?__</p>
