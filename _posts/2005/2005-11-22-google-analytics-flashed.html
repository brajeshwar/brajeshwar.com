<p>I always believed that Google is more about non-flash and more of @XMLHttpRequest@. Brajeshwar.com is on "Mediatemple (Mediatemple)":http://www.mediatemple.net/, they have urchin for the site stats and I know that Urchin had nothing flashy about them. I use more of "Mint (Mint)":http://www.haveamint.com/ to study the statistics but I am sure I will be more on Google Analytics for more details.</p>
<p>I signed up for "Google Analytics (Google Analytics)":http://analytics.google.com/ recently but the tracking started today and I was amazed at the cool interface, the detailed reports. Well, most of the reports, graphs __et al__ are done in Flash. I am pretty sure there's more to it than just meets the eye but it is cool to see Flash being used in one of the most appropriate style.</p>
<p>"Google Analytics (Google Analytics)":http://analytics.google.com/, I am loving it.<br />
__Somehow I can no longer add more sites to track, they seem to have stopped accepting new one for the time being.__</p>
