<p><?php ImgBlog("blogobabble/AjaxCleanser.jpg", 0, "Ajax Cleanser", "");?> I stumble upon something while doing some study. Here is a short story about AJAX.</p>
<p>William Colgate started a candle and soap making company in New York City in 1806. By 1906, the company was making over 3,000 different soaps, perfumes and other products. Colgate Dental Cream was introduced in 1877. In 1864, Caleb Johnson founded a soap company called  B.J. Johnson Soap Co., in Milwaukee. In 1898, this company introduced a soap made of palm and olive oils, called Palmolive. It was so successful that that the B.J. Johnson Soap Co. changed their name to Palmolive in 1917. Another soap making company called the Peet Brothers Co. of Kansas City started in 1872. In 1927, Palmolive merged with them to became Palmolive Peet. In 1928, Palmolive Peet merged with Colgate to form Colgate-Palmolive-Peet. In 1953, the name was shortened to just Colgate-Palmolive. *Ajax* cleanser was one of their first major brand names introduced in the early 1940s.</p>
