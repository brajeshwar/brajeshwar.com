<p>We all know that Flash uses only reference counting to do garbage collection. So, we have come to the decision that it is a wise idea to take special care to dispose circular references as these tend to hang around a lot. In ActionScript, take care that you are cleaning up external references before destroying or unloading movieclips. Our internal team usually have a dispose method in most of the objects that nulls external references before hand.</p>
<p>bc[as]. // for movieclip subclasses<br />
public function dispose ():Void<br />
{<br />
 externalRef = null;<br />
 this.removeMovieClip ();<br />
};<br />
//<br />
// for other class instances use something like<br />
myObject.dispose ();<br />
myObject = null;</p>
