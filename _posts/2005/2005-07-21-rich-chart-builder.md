<p>"Rich Chart Builder (Rich Chart Builder)":http://blue-pacific.com/products/richchartbuilder/ from "Blue Pacific (Blue Pacific)":http://blue-pacific.com/ is an easy to use chart builder which outputs to SWFs.</p>
<p>I am particularly impressed by the amount of ready-made charts it have. The only put down for me was that I cannot use it in my applications __per se__. I can neither extend it nor does it allow me to have it in my Flash Applications. But this is a good option, if your final Charting requirement is a standalone presentation/application.</p>
<p>Its salient features are;</p>
<p>* Creates animated Rich Media charts that present your data in an enjoyable and captivating experience.<br />
* Charts can contain an audio narration: an effective way of describing the events behind the values.<br />
* Create interactive charts with tooltips and links that can point to other charts or web documents, creating a truly interactive experience.<br />
* Publish the resulting chart to ubiquitous Flash format viewable by over than 98% of web users. And also to PowerPoint, Image and PDF documents.<br />
* Includes a wealth of professionally designed chart Templates and Layouts which you can apply to your charts.<br />
* Works with Microsoft Office - import data from Excel and publish the resulting chart to a PowerPoint presentation.<br />
* Includes real time preview - while you are adjusting the chart parameters, the resulting effect can be seen immediately in the preview area.</p>
