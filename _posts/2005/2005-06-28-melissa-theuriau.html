<p>Little did I realize that my site will crawl to its knees when I uploaded her pictures for the archives. My site crawled to a halt, and my hosting provider warned of gulping up 15GB this month.</p>
<p>Most of the bandwidth flux turns out to be because of a woman, whose picture I uploaded -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mélissa_Theuriau">Mélissa Theuriau</a>. I have decided to offload the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72057594083521408/">Photos</a> elsewhere.</p>
