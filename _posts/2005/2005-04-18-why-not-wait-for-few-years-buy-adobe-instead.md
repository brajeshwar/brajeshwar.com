<p>Well, I have almost done away with most Adobe Products because there are already good (read better) Macromedia replacements. I have even learnt to use Fireworks pretty well, but that's sure gonna go. The news is everywhere and my reaction is "*Confused*", crossed fingers, bite nails and wait and watch for the road ahead.</p>
<p>But with the current growth of Macromedia, why not wait for coupla years and buy Adobe instead?</p>
<p>__For the archive__:<br />
Adobe acquires Macromedia, read the press releases on "Adobe (Adobe)":http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html and on "Macromedia (Macromedia)":http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2005/adobe_macromedia.html</p>
