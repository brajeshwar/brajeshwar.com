<p>Just finished reading "Ted Patrick embracing Flex (Ted Patrick embracing Flex)":http://www.powersdk.com/ted/2005/05/embracing-flex-and-new-company.php and start of his new company. Congratulations and best wishes to Ted. His article is one which you can share and discuss with your team, try to learn and be inspired by the same. It did make me realize that I should spend less time on Movies and spend more time with my computer.</p>
