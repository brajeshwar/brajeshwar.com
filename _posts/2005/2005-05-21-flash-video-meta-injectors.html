<p>Well, I was looking for simple way to find out the width and height of FLVs. I found two good tools which does lot more than what I wished for, "FLV MetaData Injector (FLV MetaData Injector)":http://www.buraks.com/flvmdi/ and "FLVTool2 (FLVTool2)":http://inlet-media.de/flvtool2/.</p>
<p>"FLV MetaData Injector (FLV MetaData Injector)":http://www.buraks.com/flvmdi/, from "Buraks (Buraks)":http://www.buraks.com/, is a command line tool that adds the required Meta Data at the header of FLV files. You can even save an xml version of the details so generated. There is a GUI tool to make life easier, it even even allows you to select a folder and run the tool on the whole folder containing many FLVs.</p>
<p>"FLVTool2 (FLVTool2)":http://inlet-media.de/flvtool2/ is another command line FLV Metadata Injector tool. Unlike the one from Buraks, this lacks a GUI interface.</p>
<p>Both the tools being command-line based, they can be used on the server to manipulate FLVs using a Server Side Script.</p>
