<p>"Fiddler (Fiddler, a HTTP Debugging Proxy)":http://www.fiddlertool.com/ is a HTTP Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP Traffic, set breakpoints, and "fiddle" with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a simple but powerful JScript.NET event-based scripting subsystem.</p>
