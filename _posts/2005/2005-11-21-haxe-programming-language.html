<p>Here is something that you should keep a tap on! "haXe (haXe)":http://haxe.org/ is a programming language from the "mtasc (mtasc)":http://mtasc.org/ guy and I would really be interested into looking closely at something that comes from him. The haXe programming language is one supposedly a common language for the different technologies; server side, client side and rich clients (read Flash, Flex here).</p>
<p>*haXe can*</p>
<p>* create Flash SWF files using Flash APIs for Players 6, 7, 8, 8.5<br />
* generate Javascript code using Browser DHTML API, so you can create AJAX web applications<br />
* generate Neko sourcecode that can be used on the Server side or in standalone executable</p>
