<p><?php ImgBlog("general/mint.jpg", 0, "Mint", "http://www.haveamint.com/");?>I have installed "Mint (Mint)":http://www.haveamint.com/ coupla hours ago and I am enjoying it, looking how it fills up the space and the way it shows important information in a clear and concise manner. I have my eye on it for quite sometime but today I took the decision and got it for my site. My impression so far is very good and am likely to go for some of my other domains. With some of the cool pepper plugins, Mint is something I would recommend if you don't have a seriously good webstats application for your website. I went for mint specially for the simplicity, the minimal but appropriate information. So, go and "have a mint (have a mint)":http://www.haveamint.com/ and add some pepper too. Some of the pepper I have currently at *User Agent 007, Outclicks, xxx Strong Mint, Download Counter*. Currently, with a price tag of $30 per site, this is a real steal.</p>
<p>Though they don't have a refund scheme, they let you test your server for "Mint Server Compatibility Suite (Mint Server Compatibility Suite)":http://www.haveamint.com/mint-scs.zip. Check out the "server requirements (server requirements)":http://www.haveamint.com/requirements/ before purchasing the same.</p>
<p>Installation was also an easy one, I used the @php_value auto_prepend_file@ and the output buffer, change/add few lines in the .htaccess file. And, that was it, Mint was running. There are more easier ways of getting mint for your site, "check it out (mint)":http://www.haveamint.com/.</p>
