<p>I had been preparing myself for another rejection of VISA, this time the US. Somewhere in early February this year, the Australian Consulate <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2005/debarred-from-mxdu-2005/">rejected my VISA application</a> regarding my MXDU Speakership. It did not look so favorable this time too with the US Consulate. I applied late, went off to <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2005/singapore-in-2005-march/">Singapore</a>. And I had the same old documents that I used during the Australian VISA request.</p>
<p>Finally, I got the personal interview on March 28, 2005, got finger printed and a good guy, "Frederick Brunt", who took my interview gave me the VISA rather easily. I had requested for a minimum of just one week VISA but I realized I got a VISA valid till 2015. He did not even look at the bunch of paperworks that I was carrying. He only looked at the Invitation Letter from "Powered by Detroit", he consulted and looked at the website. Asked me what I do, what are Rich Internet Applications, What do you I with Flash? What are these Conferences? What do they do? Where is Imphal? As I answered them, he told me, "Sir, I will give you the Visa and your passport will be couriered to you within a day."</p>
<p>So, all things are taken care of, I will be speaking at two sessions at the <a href="http://www.poweredbydetroit.org/">Powered by Detroit CF/Flash Conference</a> Detroit, Michigan, US from April 9-10, 2005 at the Hyatt Regency Dearborn, Detroit, MI (USA).</p>
