<p>It looks like the whole rage against Internet Explorer have started again with wilder fury. I just saw Boing Boing's post about "Kill Bill's Browser (Kill Bill's Browser)":http://www.killbillsbrowser.com/. They have *13 hilarious Reasons to Swtich from Internet explorer to Firefox*.</p>
<p>Not only that, there is also the "Explorer Destroyer (Explorer Destroyer)":http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/. Their claim is that for each person you switch, "Google (Google)":http://www.google.com/ gives you $1, "Microsoft (Microsoft)":http://www.microsoft.com/ loses marketshare, and an angel gets its wings.</p>
<p>Personally, I am not really against Internet Explorer or any browser for that metter though I prefer Firefox as my primary browser. I use Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6.0 to check site compatibility during development, besides Opera 8.5, Netscape 8.0 and the newly released Developer version of "Flock (Flock)":http://www.flock.com/. My site still stats about 70% visitors with Internet explorer while Firefox a meagre 25%, the remaining are shared between Safari, Opera, Netscape, Mozilla, Camino and some feed reader, crawler agents.</p>
