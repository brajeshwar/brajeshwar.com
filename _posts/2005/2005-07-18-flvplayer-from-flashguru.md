<p>"Guy Watson (Guy Watson)":http://www.flashguru.co.uk/ have a nifty tool, "FLVPlayer (FLVPlayer)":http://www.flashguru.co.uk/free-tool-flash-video-player/ which associates itself with FLVs on a windows box. With this FLVPlayer installed, double clicking on any FLV will launch it and play the FLV.</p>
