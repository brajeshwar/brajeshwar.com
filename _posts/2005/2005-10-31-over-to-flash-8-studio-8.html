<p><?php ImgBlog("flash/studio8.jpg", 1, "Studio 8", "http://www.macromedia.com/go/studio/");?>Finally, we got our Studio 8 licenses and we are ready to rock and roll with 8th incarnation of Flash, Dreaamweaver. Personally, I have not re-installed Studio MX 2004/Flash 7 ever since my "Notebook crashed (Notebook crashed)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2005/09/thou_shall_backup_ev/ and have been on Flash 8 for quite somtime (or rather a very long time). Our "Dev Team (Dev Team)":http://www.oinam.com/ will very soon be using Studio 8 and move away from Studio MX 2004 altogether. I would like to thank "Macromedia (Macromedia)":http://www.macromedia.com/ yet again.</p>
<p>Btw, "Dreamweaver 8 Review (Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 Review)":http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200510/macromedia_dreamweaver_8_review/ is a good review of a "WYSIWYG (WYSIWYG)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG Designer/Developer tool from a "hand coder (hand coder)":http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/hand_coding/.</p>
