<p>I am not really in any position to say if AsSetPropFlags is totally gone or have been kept dormant for a while. But then, let us heed to what Macromedia wants (or rather don't want). I have the feeling Macromedia wants to say, "Please don't try to peek into all the features of the new player yet".</p>
