<p>"Jonathan Boutelle (Jonathan Boutelle)":http://www.jonathanboutelle.com/whoami/ have an interesting article about the "current boom of collaboration tools (current boom of collaboration tools)":http://www.jonathanboutelle.com/mt/archives/2005/06/the_coming_boom.html. The eye-catching phrase that came up was - his concern for Flash Developers who are concentrating more on doing e-learning projects and not really harnessing the power of Flash, FlashCom, Flash Remoting and Flex.</p>
<p>__An excerpt;__<br />
Flash hackers should pay particular attention to this trend. The only decent zero-install technology that allows the server to push content to a client is the flash communications server. That ability is crucial to real-time collaboration (as opposed to the asynchorous collaboration you see in bug-tracking and project-management systems). If Flash developers can stop working on elearning projects for a few months they could easily build some great tools for this space, tools that would be valued at a premium in the current market.</p>
