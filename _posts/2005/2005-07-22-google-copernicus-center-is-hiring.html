<p><?php ImgBlog("blogobabble/GoogleCheese.jpg", 1, "Google Copernicus Hosting Environment and Experiment in Search Engineering", "http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html");?> Google is interviewing candidates for engineering positions at their lunar hosting and research center, opening late in the spring of 2007. The opportunity is available only to highly-qualified individuals who are willing to relocate for an extended period of time, are in top physical condition and are capable of surviving with limited access to such modern conveniences as soy low-fat lattes, The Sopranos and a steady supply of oxygen.</p>
<p>__The Google Copernicus Hosting Environment and Experiment in Search Engineering (G.C.H.E.E.S.E.) is a fully integrated research, development and technology facility at which Google will be conducting experiments in entropized information filtering, high-density high-delivery hosting (HiDeHiDeHo) and de-oxygenated cubicle dwelling. This center will provide a unique platform from which Google will leapfrog current terrestrial-based technologies and bring information access to new heights of utility.__</p>
