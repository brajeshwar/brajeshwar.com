I never realized that people will be wacking the Penguin that much. But recently after installing "Mint (Mint)":http://www.haveamint.com/ and checking out the *Current Activity* Pepper, I see that the most amount of time people spent on my site was on the penguins and not the articles. ;-)</p>

<p>If you are playing them, then there was another simple one called the "Bubblewrap (Bubblewrap)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/documents/bubblewrap/.<br />
And Macromedia have their "Penguin Game (MM Penguin Game)":http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/holiday2004/ too.</p>
