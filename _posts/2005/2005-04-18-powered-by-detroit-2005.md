<p>The "Powered by Detroit (Powered by Detroit)":http://www.poweredbydetroit.org/, 2005 proved to be a good starting ground for me. Just like everybody else, I enjoyed the two days very much, met many people. The conference wasn't a Flash-oriented conference __per se__ but even then, the responses were good. I liked the questions/answers part of my session more than my actual presentation. Both of my sessions were not really Powerpoint Presentation oriented, so it is difficult to give away a presentation slide or anything similar. I showcased two RIAs done with Macromedia Flash, Flash Remoting, Flash Communication Server and ColdFusion.</p>
<p>Besides all the nice people, the one person who would love to talk on anything and whom people love to listen was "Michael Dinowitz (Michael Dinowitz, House of Fusion)":http://houseoffusion.com/. I particularly liked him talking about Comics, which was also perhaps his specialty. Met up with "Oscar Trelles (Oscar Trelles)":http://www.oscartrelles.com/blog/, went to the Ford Museum with him and he even invited me to "Yahoo!360&deg; (Yahoo!360&deg;)":http://360.yahoo.com/. Finally met Edward Sullivan in person, shook hands with Ben Forta, chatted with the "Alagad (Alagad)":http://www.alagad.com/ guy, "Doug Hughes (Doug Hughes)":http://www.doughughes.net/. And enjoyed the whole two-day conference with all the people there.</p>
