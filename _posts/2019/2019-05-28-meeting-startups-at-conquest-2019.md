<p>I'm one of the mentors at the <a href="http://conquest.org.in/">Conquest</a>, 2019. I met up with some of the Startups.</p>
<h2>Aayush</h2>
<p>Aayush built a cost-effective ingestible battery-less electronic Health Pill that transmits data via a patch that can be easily applied on the body. That patch communicates with a Smartphone App and helps in the prediction and prevention of Heart attacks and Sudden Cardiac Arrests.</p>
<p>The Health Pill uses MicroSensor Technology that can be swallowed by a person. The pill enters the Gastro-Intestinal Tract in the stomach and becomes electrically activated when it reacts with the digestive acids present in the stomach, thus generating a natural electric current. The embedded  Bio-Medical sensors once activated, record specific physiological Health metrics from the body. These health data are transmitted to an app via a Wearable Transmission Patch that can easily stick to the body.</p>
<p>These data are stored in the cloud which is can be accessed by family members, friends, caretakers, and doctors who have access to the data. The app monitors health data round the clock and simultaneously identifies, analyzes, and can warn about 9-11 minutes prior to a Heart Attack or Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Emergency Alerts are sent to the victim, predefined members, and to the nearest Hospital along with the current GPS location of the victim.</p>
<p>Aayush built a unique microsensor technology, which is cost-effective, smart private healthcare technology that can be used without the need of doctor's assistance. Aayush plans to license their product and technology to various hospitals, once their patent is granted.</p>
<h2>Xplorazzi</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.xplorazzi.com/">Xplorazzi</a> is building an automated tool which will take retail shop shelf images and CCTV video feed to create Planograms.</p>
<p>Planograms are a crucial part of today’s retail stores. It can be done manually to comply with audit requirements or use software that is an additional cost to the retailers.</p>
<p>Xplorazzi uses imaging technology, deep learning, and sales data to build a smartphone app that will aid retail stores to do items assessment. This will create a consistent visual record to automate the process and use the details for Audit, Assortment Analysis, Stock Management, Shelf-Space availability, and Dynamic Analysis Reports.</p>
<h2>Untangled Cloud</p>
<p><a href="https://untangled.cloud/">Untangled Cloud</a> makes it easy to work across multiple Cloud providers such as Amazon’s AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft’s Azure.</p>
<p>Untangled Cloud provides analytics and tools to help Startups and SMEs make better decisions while choosing the right cloud service providers. They help in upskilling teams to learn more about the services of various cloud providers. They also plan to build tools to help migrate from one cloud provider to the other easily and seamlessly. </p>
<h2>Pigeon</h2>
<p><a href="https://pigeonapp.io/">Pigeon</a> is "Zapier for Notifications."</p>
<p>Pigeon has built an easy to use system that helps businesses manage user notifications & preferences across multiple channels -- emails, apps, instant messaging apps, and text messages in one place.</p>
<p>Pigeon targets 3 distinct areas;</p>
<ol>
<li>Content Management System (CMS) for Notifications: Normally, notification messages are coded in by the developers. With Pigeon's online Email, Push  & SMS editors, marketing & sales teams are empowered to make changes themselves, resulting in faster iterations and can avoid wasted dev cycles.</li>
<li>User Preferences Manager: Users are used to applications like Facebook that provide a high degree of control over notifications. With Pigeon, your users can choose which devices they would like to receive notifications, the time and even control the types of notifications. Pigeon handles all the processing for you. Developers don't need to re-create this and can focus on their core business logic.</li>
<li>Event-Driven Notification System: With our unique event-based model, Pigeon empowers marketing & sales teams to control the logic of the notifications online. Developers simply hook various events through the app.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Loka</h2>
<p>Loka is a hyper-local vernacular QnA app for consumers & local businesses.</p>
<p>Loka’s hypothesis is that about 90% of Indians do not speak English and would rather use a vernacular language that they are comfortable in. They want to bank on that fact and build a community of local businesses and consumers that communicate in vernacular Indian languages.</p>
<p>Loka wants to be the growth-hack platform for local businesses and consumers to ask questions and get answers from their neighborhoods in their local languages.</p>
<h2>PROI</h2>
<p>PROI is developing a hardware-based POS system for retailers that aims to build a data-driven analytics solution.</p>
<p>There are 10-15 million retail stores in India.  But the retail sector is very traditional and unorganized. There is no  Inventory and Supply Chain Management system, no data-driven In-Store  Management and Forecasting and no large scale retail data provision for the hyperlocal market. In order to organize this industry, PROI will be collecting the data and setting the path for future collaborators. They plan to connect the entire Supply Chain - Retailers, Manufacturers, and Hyper-Local Markets.</p>
<p>PROI aims to help SMEs to compete at the same level as the big players in the industry by providing them the capability to make data-driven decisions and optimize their supply chain. They follow a  bottom-up approach while approaching the Hyperlocal market environment.</h2>
