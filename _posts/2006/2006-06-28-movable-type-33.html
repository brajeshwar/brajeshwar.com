<p>I have been beta testing "Movable Type 3.3 (Movable Type 3.3)":http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/beta/ and was pretty impressed with many new features. Of all the features, my favorites are that of *tags*, *stylecatcher* and the "dirify function fix (dirify function fix)":http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200510/fixing_the_dirify_function_in_movable_type/ (I was religiously following this one!). I have not been able to play with the *Widgets* yet. I am still a happy user of "Movable Type (Movable Type)":http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/ though I now have mastered "Wordpress (Wordpress)":http://www.wordpress.org/ enough to use it on many other blogs. Yes, wordpress is way easier to setup, maintain and change than Movable Type. However, when it comes to multiple blogs from a single installation, Movable Type is the champ.</p>
<p>"Movable Type (Movable Type)":http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/ 3.3 is ready for release and should be out anytime. You can participate, view the poll about the "Best standalone blog application (Best standalone blog application)":http://lifehacker.com/software/web-publishing/reader-poll--best-standalone-blog-application-183428.php.</p>
