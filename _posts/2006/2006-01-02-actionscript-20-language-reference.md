<p>I have been meaning to have this bookmarked and I am sure I did it but somehow keep missing it whenever I needed it to refer to people. One of the sweet lady at -Macromedia- "Adobe (Adobe)":http://www.adobe.com/, "Jen Dehaan (Jen Dehaan)":http://weblogs.macromedia.com/dehaan/ have blogged about it long back. We have it hosted as html reference for our team in our internal server, I have been longing to have it on my own site for the archives and personal reference too.</p>
