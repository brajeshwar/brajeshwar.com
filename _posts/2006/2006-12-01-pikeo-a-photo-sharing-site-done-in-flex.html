<p>I saw Pikeo featured on "Techcrunch (Techcrunch)":http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/29/new-phot-sharing-site-se-habla-espanol-et-francais/ after which I signed up and  tried using it. "Pikeo (Pikeo)":http://www.pikeo.com/ is a photo sharing site. Upon activating the link through my email, I noticed something very familiar, most of the flash related interface are done with "Flex (Flex)":http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/.</p>
<p>Techcrunch reports that; _Pikeo also has a fast uploading function that doesnÃ‡Æ’Ã™t require users to download a pesky desktop application. You can upload an entire folder directly from the site and it works in the background so that users can continue to browse photos while uploading their own._ Well, we know that this is because it uses the "Flash File Upload ()":http://blog.oinam.com/archives/2005/08/flash-8-file-upload-download/ coolness.</p>
