<p>Our team had to spend few frantic minutes trying to find _that application_ that compiles FLAs from the Context Menu. I had it but archived somewhere in Mumbai (INDIA) about 160 km (or about 2 hrs drive) away from where I am right now. And the original site, "ugoletti (ugoletti)":http://www.ugoletti.com/, is now under construction.</p>
<p>With full credit to "Daniele Ugoletti (Daniele Ugoletti)":http://www.ugoletti.com/ and permission from him, I am mirroring "Flash Shell Extension (Flash Shell Extension)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/downloads/misc/FlashShellExtension_1.3.exe, in its original form/code/shape, for download on my site.</p>
<p>Download Flash Shell Extension - "Zip (Zip)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/downloads/misc/FlashShellExtension_1.3.zip | "7z (7z)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/downloads/misc/FlashShellExtension_1.3.7z | "Exe (Installer)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/downloads/misc/FlashShellExtension_1.3.exe<br />
Note: This application is for windows!</p>
