(What are CSS Sprites?)":http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=447210&rl=1</p>
<p>Have a look at the original article [by "Dave Shea (Dave Shea)":http://www.mezzoblue.com/] published  on "A List Apart (A List Apart)":http://www.alistapart.com/, "CSS Sprites: Image Slicing's Kiss of Death (CSS Sprites: Image Slicing's Kiss of Death)":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites.</p>
