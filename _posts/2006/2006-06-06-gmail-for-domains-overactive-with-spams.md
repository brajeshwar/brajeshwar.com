<p>"Oinam.com got invited to Gmails for Domains (Gmail for Oinam.com)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/157216904/ about a week back and everything else is working save for few issues of outgoing mails with Thunderbird (haven't found a solution yet). If anybody have a solution to that, let me know. Well, the next issue is that Gmail is so active with spam that I got a bunch of authentic mails got netted in the Gmail Spam Filter. After seriously searching for the lost mails, I finally peep into the junk folder to find a bunch of non-spam mails.</p>
<p>Lesson learnt - *Check your Junk Folder Regularly* - aaarrrgggg !</p>
