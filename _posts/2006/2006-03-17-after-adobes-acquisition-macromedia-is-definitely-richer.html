<p>As far as I can recollect, Macromedia's MAX was usually just coupla days. The upcoming first "MAX (Adobe MAX )":http://www.adobe.com/events/max/ after acquisition is being celebrated for about a week, October 22 - 26 (add a day before for the usual bird of a feather kinda gathering and another day after for the farewell). And it is Las Vegas!</p>
