<p>Well, I wasn't aware that "Chris Georgenes (Chris Georgenes)":http://www.mudbubble.com/ was blogging or do I (I'm not sure but I feel I wasn't aware of it before). Chris is one of the best Flash animators of the world. Today, I saw a hit-back to my site from "Keyframer (Keyframer)":http://www.keyframer.com/ and well, Chris had been blogging since March 2006. I once did asked if there are any more Flash Designers and Developers who are "not blogging (Flashers who are not blogging)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2003/11/flashers-who-do-not-you-have-a-blog-please-stand-up/ and he commented he was not.</p>
