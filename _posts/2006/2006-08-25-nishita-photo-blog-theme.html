excerpt: A simple, sleek and minimal (quick and simple install/setup) Photo Blog theme
  for Wordpress - "Nishita (Nishita)":http://www.clipthephotos.com/. Nishita came
  to my mind as I felt the need of a simple Photo blog to highlight some of the selected
  photographs from on my "Flickr Photos (Brajeshwar's photos)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/.

<p>I have a bunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/">Photos on Flickr</a>. Even though I was beta testing <strong>Flickr</strong> ever since it came up and had a pro account gifted by them, I really never used it for my photos. I moved to Flickr from my own <strong>Gallery</strong> hosted Photo Section (I lost all the photo comments eventually), somewhere late February 2006. Since then online Photo Management and storage have become a pleasant experience for me. A couple of days back, my photo collection hit 50,000 views (as seen on my Flickr Page).</p>
<p>To commemorate the nice things happening around, I would like to contribute another small offering for the public to use. A simple, sleek and minimal (quick and simple install/setup) Photo Blog theme for Wordpress - <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/nishita">Nishita</a>. </p>
