<p>Read about "RIAForge (RIAForge)":http://www.riaforge.org/ across coupla blogs. Brainchild of "Ben Forta (Ben Forta)":http://www.forta.com/, RIAForge is developed by "Raymond Camden (Raymond Camden)":http://ray.camdenfamily.com/.</p>
<p>RIAForge is about integrating existing or new open source projects in a centralized repository with simple functions and options for managing projects and more complex options for managing source code. It provides a consolidated hosting environment that transcends tools, geographies and functional teams and enables more efficient use of your time and resources.</p>
