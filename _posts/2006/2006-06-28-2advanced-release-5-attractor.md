<p>I went to "2Advanced (2Advanced)":http://www.2advanced.com/ today for a reason which I will blog very soon. I saw that their "Release 5 - Attractor (Release 5 - Attractor)":http://www.2advanced.com/ is up. If this is old news, I think I missed it and I haven't found anything related to reactor on their "PLAT4M (PLAT4M)":http://www.plat4m.com/.</p>
<p>Listen to the "Podcast Interview (Podcast for Designers)":http://www.podcastsfordesigners.com/ with 2A's Eric Jordan and Tony Novak regarding the development of 2Advanced V.5 "Attractor".</p>
