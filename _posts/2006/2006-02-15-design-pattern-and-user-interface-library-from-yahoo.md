<p>Everyone have blogged about "Design Pattern Library (Design Pattern Library)":http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/ and "User Interface Library (User Interface Library)":http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/ from "Yahoo! Developer Network (Yahoo! Developer Network)":http://developer.yahoo.net/. Let me do my bit for the archive.</p>
<p>The *Yahoo! User Interface Library* is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, HTML and AJAX. The UI Library Utilities facilitate the implementation of rich client-side features by enhancing and normalizing the developer's interface to important elements of the browser infrastructure (such as events, in-page HTTP requests and the DOM). The Yahoo UI Library Controls produce visual, interactive user interface elements on the page with just a few lines of code and an included CSS file. All the components in the Yahoo! User Interface Library have been released as open source under a BSD license and are free for all uses.</p>

<p>The *Yahoo! Design Pattern Library* is an evolving set of sophisticated design guidelines for building web pages and applications. The design patterns do not require the Yahoo! UI Library components, although using the UI Library can help you more easily implement the patterns.</p>
<p>The Yahoo! UI Library downloads contains documentations, source files and examples of the various libraries.</p>
