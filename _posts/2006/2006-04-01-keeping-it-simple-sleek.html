<p>Well, I got tired of my old layout (again); and here comes the new layout - <a href="http://theme.brajeshwar.com/">Brajeshwar v7.0</a>. The theme is about *Keeping it Simple & Sleek*; minimal, less color, less markups. I am open to comments, feedbacks, criticisms for the new layout. Thanks to those who have mailed and reported about errors, bugs.</p>
