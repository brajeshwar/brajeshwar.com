<p><?php ImgBlog("general/vista-wallpaper.jpg", 1, "Microsoft Vista Wallpaper", "http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2006/11/microsoft-windows-vista-wallpapers/");?>Alright, I had stopped looking at referrers that goes to the "Vista Wallpapers (Vista Wallpapers)":/archives/2006/11/microsoft-windows-vista-wallpapers/ but today I saw something strange at my *Unique Referrer* RSS feed of my site. Yes, I subscribe to my Mint's Referrer RSS Feed instead of going to Mint everyday. About a month back, my site was "Lifehackered (Lifehackered)":http://www.lifehacker.com/software/wallpaper/free-windows-vista-wallpaper-217114.php and it seriously beats all other referrer now. The surprise I saw today was when my site got "Reuters-ed (Reuters-ed)":http://today.reuters.com/News/ArticleBlog.aspx?type=technologyNews&w1=B7ovpm21IaDoL40ZFnNfGe&w2=B82x9Ksc5UNVzDjpITcIrRbi&src=blogBurst_technologyNews&bbPostId=CzBrwwbnhPUOdCz5x9FDMaTOCUAaUGC6n8mUsCzCNgl8eMm7Qv. Well, it got "Gigazined (Gigazined)":http://gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20061126_vistawall/ for the same Vista Wallpapers. The article too got "dugg (dugg)":http://www.digg.com/ indirectly. My special thanks to all who have shown interest in my blog.</p>
