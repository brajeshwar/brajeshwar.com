<p>"Wink (Wink)":http://www.debugmode.com/wink/ is a free and an easy to use screen capture software. It takes specific number of screenshots of the specified window, area or screen including keyboard and mouse events. Infact, one can capture anything in wink. Once a capture is done, the user can edit the thumbnails (key frames), add text, shapes, audio, navigation buttons and/or hyperliks.</p>
<p>Preloaders can also be added in wink and they are customisable to a great extent. The power of wink lies in its optimisation capacity, its low CPU usage and a light footprint. Optionally, a minimal set of color can be selected which reduces the file size amazingly. Wink can export the captured data to PDF which is a great feature by itself.</p>
<p>Thanks to "Sagar Parikh (Sagar Parikh)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/170296833/ for testing this software.</p>
