<p>I knew that the meetings that we had are all successful ones with to-the-point discussions, coming out with objectives which we know what to do, when to do and who will do. So, I was always on the look-out for how to express that all Meetings are not that harmful.</p>
<p>I just saw "37Signal (37Signal)":http://www.37signals.com/ come up with almost all the points which helped me gather up my semi-formed points that was in my mind.</p>
<p>Here are the points verbattim from "37Signal (37Signal)":http://www.37signals.com/;</p>
<p># Begin with a specific problem. Meetings are wild horses that always try to run off course. Yoke the meeting to a specific problem. Ã‡Æ’?Improve the flow on the New Entry pageÃ‡Æ’? is better than Ã‡Æ’?Talk about New Entry page.Ã‡Æ’?<br />
# Meet on site. Meet at the site of the problem instead of the conference room. Get in front of the code, in front of the UI, and talk about it together. Point to real things and suggest real changes.<br />
3 End with a solution and responsible parties. Your next action will be concrete if the problem is solved. YouÃ‡Æ’Ã™re ready to go when you know what will be done and by whom. If you canÃ‡Æ’Ã™t find a concrete solution, end the meeting and come back when you understand the problem better.<br />
# Celebrate, shut up, and do something. Celebrate the solution. ItÃ‡Æ’Ã™s good when heads come together and solve a problem. ItÃ‡Æ’Ã™s great when they get back to work and build the damn thing.</p>
