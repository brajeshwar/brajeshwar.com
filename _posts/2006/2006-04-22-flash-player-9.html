<p>Adobe have decided to rename "Flash Player 8.5 to Flash Player 9 (Flash Player 8.5 to Flash Player 9)":http://labs.macromedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Flash_Player#FAQs.</p>
<p>Some of the good reasons being discussed are;</p>

* easier to talk to clients and marketing folks<br />
* _still thinking of more_</p>
