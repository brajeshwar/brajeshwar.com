<p>I voted Titanium. At the time of my vote, all other countries are on that side - the Titanium - except for Africa. "Cast your vote (Cast your vote)":http://www.whichsideareyouon.com/ today for Lenovo's new Thinkpad (Widescreen Z60 series).</p>
<p>"So, Which Side Are You? Black or Titanium? (So, Which Side Are You? Black or Titanium?)":http://www.whichsideareyouon.com/</p>
<p>I was shown the widescreen black last week and told that it was yet to be released in India, I am unable to recollect if that was the Z60 series!</p>
