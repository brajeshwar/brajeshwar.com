<p>I don't really recollect when they started their first chapter but I am sure it was a long time ago. The last chapter must be almost a year old. "Xombie (Xombie)":http://www.xombified.com/ finally released their "7th Chapter - Thunder and Light (7th Chapter - Thunder and Light)":http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/292568.</p>
<p>Browse through the full "Chapter Listing (Chapter Listing)":http://www.xombified.com/episodes.html. I don't quite remember but there were few other coupla chaptered episodes done in flash which I really liked.</p>
<p>Enjoy "Xombie (Xombie)":http://www.xombified.com/.</p>
