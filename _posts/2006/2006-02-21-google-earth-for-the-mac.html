<p>Most of Google's product are windows based and not really for the Mac! It is rumored - Google believes that Apple already does very good with its own products, it is the Windows users that need help. :-(</p>
<p>However, "Google Earth (Google Earth)":http://earth.google.com/ have come out with the "Google Earth Mac Version (Google Earth Mac Version)":http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html. Google Earth Plus and Google Earth Pro are not yet available for Mac.</p>
