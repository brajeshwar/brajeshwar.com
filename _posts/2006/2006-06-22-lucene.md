<p>"Lucene (Lucene)":http://lucene.apache.org/ is a Java-based open source toolkit for text indexing and searching. It is easy to use, flexible, and powerful -- a model of good object-oriented software architecture. Powerful abstractions and useful concrete implementations make Lucene very flexible, and allow new users to get up and running quickly and painlessly.
