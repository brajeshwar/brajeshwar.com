<p>I was talking to one of my colleague and told that I am a bit bored these days doing similar stuffs. I ask him if I should try a bit more of "haXe (haXe)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2005/11/haxe-programming-language/, he told me to look at "EHX (EcliHaXe)":http://www.rgenerat.org/ehx/, a plugin of Eclipse.</p>
<p>*How to "download (download)":http://www.rgenerat.org/ehx/?page_id=5 EHX(EcliHaXe)?*<br />
In Eclipse, Go to Help > Software Updates > Find And Install > Search for new features. And then use the remote URL _http://www.eclihaxe.org/update/_.</p>
