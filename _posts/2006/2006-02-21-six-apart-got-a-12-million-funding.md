<p>"Six Apart (Six Apart)":http://www.sixapart.com/, the MovableType Company seem to have got their "third round of VC funding (third round of VC funding)":http://www.iddmagazine.com/idd//NYTSStories/nytsstories.cfm?id=12032&issueDate=current, a sum of $12 million. It looks like the Internet Technology is going great guns and is on a much steady move this time. Every circle seem to have some sorta funding or the other, companies being bought, millions of dollars pumped in again.</p>
<p>I don't really recollect where I heard/read that but somebody said something cool - Have you seen/heard about VC fundings and Angel Fundings in the other areas save the Bay area, the valley, that is where the moolah is. Maybe, he was right.</p>
