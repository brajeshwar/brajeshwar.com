<p>Here is a funny article - "God is a .Net Programmer (God is a .Net Programmer)":http://jroller.com/page/agoncal?entry=god_is_a_net_programmer</p>
<p>"God created the universe, the planet and Man in just 7 days. And you can see the mess. Imagine if he had 40% more time to think about it, life would be better!"</p>
