<p>"Don't Blow Your Beta (Don't Blow Your Beta)":http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/09/dont-blow-your-beta/ is an eye opener article from "TechCrunch (TechCrunch)":http://www.techcrunch.com/. This is something developers and project managers should keep in mind.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from "Ajaxian (Ajaxian)":http://ajaxian.com/</p>
<p>* do not release incomplete or broken features<br />
* don't hold back features just to have new items in a month<br />
* IE still has the mainstream market, but early adopters use Firefox and Safari - ignore them at your peril<br />
* avoid the eternal "lauching soon" page - do it close to release and give info on what you are releasing<br />
* engage bloggers, and don't get into flamewars with them (even if you are right)<br />
* don't ask for any more personal info then you need</p>
<p>*Release or Public Beta?*</p>
<p>Jason of "37Signals (37Signals)":http://www.37signals.com/ said;<br />
There's a better way not to blow your beta: don't launch one at all. Public betas are rediculous. If your product is public, it's not a beta, it's a release. Take responsibility for your product. "Beta" only passes the buck to your customers Ã‡Æ’Ã“ outsourcing your pain to them.</p>
<p>Personally, it is really hard to keep to rules, follow standards in these scenarios. Well, actually, Are there any rules, standards at all? It is way difficult than even programming/coding where you know what to do, what rules to follow and which standard to use.</p>
