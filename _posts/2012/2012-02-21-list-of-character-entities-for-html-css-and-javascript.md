<p>I always had to fiddle and look around multiple sources to get the correct Character Entity with their named or numeric entity for HTML, the unicode entity for CSS, or the Octal-encoded character for Javascript.</p>
<p><small><em>For instance, in CSS, to add &rarr; in the content of :before, you can write -</em></small></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.more:before {
	content: "\2192";
	margin-right: 1em;
}
</pre>
<p>So, I decided to go ahead, spend some time and made a nice, clean, easy-to-navigate one page site to display, literally, all Character Entity for HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<p>Bookmark the page &rarr; <a href="http://brajeshwar.github.io/entities/">Character Entities (HTML, CSS & Javascript)</a>.<br />
