<p>I stumbled on this title quite a few times and I say it's total crap, full of shit.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Entrepreneur in Residence."</p></blockquote>
<p>Look around, quite a number of big companies have them. These 'entrepreneurs' flaunt their titles just as flashily as they could. Personally, I find it rather derogatory to the spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Let's look at the some of the basic definition of an Entrepreneur.</p>
<p>* A person who organizes and operates a business or businesses, taking on financial risk to do so.<br />
* An entrepreneur is an owner or manager of a business enterprise who makes money through risk and initiative.</p>
<p>Or the aptly defined definition by Inc.com -</p>
<blockquote><p>Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you're an "Entrepreneur in Residence" at Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Ebay, Google, Infosys, Microsoft, TCS, Yahoo! or any other Mega Corporation, stop doing that. Be entrepreneurial about your title and find a suitable one. You're mocking yourself and the entrepreneurial spirit of Entrepreneurs.</p>
