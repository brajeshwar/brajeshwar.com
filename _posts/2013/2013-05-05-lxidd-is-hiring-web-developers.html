<p>I hope, some day I can do a sane article about LxiDD but for now, let's be content with the fact that this is my latest work.  I started LxiDD this January (2013) and we 'released' our first version in February.</p>
<p>By March, we got our first three customers and we sorta became ramen profitable by April. We're hard at work to have a gradual curve to our revenue trajectory and we're very confident that by end of this year, 2013, LxiDD will be a profitable company.</p>
<p>We have a very small and nimble team, working for the good of our ever growing network of designers and developers.</p>
<blockquote class="alignleft"><p>LxiDD is a curated network of the best indie designers, developers, and creatives on the web, with exclusive access to top shelf clients looking for the best talent.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We're Hiring</h2>
<p>We're looking for good web developers with 2+ years of professional web development experience. Developers willing to experiment, not afraid to make mistakes and learn from it. Developers who have in-depth experience with one or more of the following programming languages - Python, Ruby, Clojure, Scala, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, we are looking for developers who do not need to be 'managed' or hand-hold on what needs to be done, not afraid to voice their concerns with the team, willing to give advice when needed and listen to suggestions for the right cause.</p>
