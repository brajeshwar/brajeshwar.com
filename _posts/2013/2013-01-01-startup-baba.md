<p><a href="http://startupbaba.com/">Startup Baba</a> is simple newsletter where we highlight some of the interesting, crazy and fun stories from the world of startup and entrepreneurship. Every newsletter consists of about five curated links and a short excerpt about the stories. We also try to include links to tools and utilities which will be useful for design and development of your product.</p>
<p>We totally understand about the annoyances of spam emails and newsletters. We will not send more than two newsletters in a week. You can unsubscribe very promptly and instantly. We will not send you anything not related to building a startup, a business and being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>So, if you think it's OK for another addition to your Startup resources, go ahead and sign-up for the newsletter from <a href="http://startupbaba.com/">Startup Baba</a>.</p>
