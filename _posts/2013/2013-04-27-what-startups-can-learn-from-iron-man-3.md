<p>Yes, as expected <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1300854/">Iron Man 3</a> was an awesome movie. The movie opens as a narrative by Tony Stark to Dr. Bruce Banner, a story that started way before Tony Stark became Iron Man. I won't be talking about the movie, I'll let you enjoy that at a theatre near you.</p>
<p>So, after the Avengers event in New York, Tony became obsessive and began prototyping lots of Iron Man suits. He moves on to another model and never have 'the one' perfect Iron Man suit.</p>
<p>Through-out the movie, you'll see that lots of Iron Man suits were used, almost all disposable and another one always ready. None of the suits were the perfect one. Even his latest best, the Mark 42 had to be done away with, serving its purpose in the finale fight.</p>
<p>As a Startup Entrepreneur, be ready to build lots of prototypes, never get stuck to a single idea, move on to the next until you can get better and better with your product. Be obsess about your product, build it, re-build it, break it and then build it again. Once you have something, bring them to the battle to fight - open them to public in the real world.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Movie.</p>
