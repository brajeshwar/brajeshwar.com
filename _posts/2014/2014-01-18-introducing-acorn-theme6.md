<p>After multiple delays and hesitations, I have finally released <a href="http://theme6.com/" title="Theme6">Theme6</a>, a site dedicated to carefully crafted and well designed themes and templates. I'm lucky to have partnered with an awesome designer - <a href="http://saneef.com/" title="Saneef Ansari">Saneef Ansari</a>. Our first release is a Typographically tailored theme for Wordpress - <a href="http://theme6.com/acorn/" title="Acorn">Acorn</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Acorn is a mobile-first, retina-ready responsive theme focused on typography and content. It is designed to be clean, simple, minimal and to stay out of the way to focus full attention to your blog posts, articles and content.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our idea is to keep it as simple as possible, without the need for any additional plugins nor custom fields. It would work without any special need to add/edit the contents of the blog posts or articles.</p>
<p>We are thrilled and would be adding more well designed themes in future.</p>
