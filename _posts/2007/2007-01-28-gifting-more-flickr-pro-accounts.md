<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>I'm no longer able to gift Flickr Pro accounts.</em></p>
<p>I was once able to "gift 2 Flickr Pro accounts (gift 2 Flickr Pro accounts)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2005/04/get-your-free-flickr-pro-account/. As an aftermath, I still receive emails, comments asking me for more pro accounts. I'm sorry, I no longer have any!</p>
<p>However, I have been thinking of *Gifting more Flickr Pro Accounts*. This came to me ever since I bought couple of Flickr Pro Account for total strangers. I remember even gifting one hugely popular Blogger, Industry Expert after seeing that he is not a Flickr Pro user. He didn't even bother to reciprocate with a simple "Thanks".</p>
<p>No, I cannot gift or buy everybody who ask for a Flickr Pro Account. It will also be my sole decision whom I should buy/gift Flickr Pro Accounts. The Flickr Pro Accounts comes as a result of the meagre earnings that I get from Ads/Sponsors on my site after paying off the hosting fee for couple of my dedicated servers.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are a good (amateur) photographer and justify a Flickr Pro Account from me, then "contact (contact)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/contact/ me directly. The deciding factors will be, with no specific reasons but good photographs, budding photographers, college students and few other reasons which I don't know myself.</p>
<p>Email me with</p>
<p># Your Flickr Photos URL.<br />
# Why do you think I should gift you a Flickr Pro Account?<br />
# Agree that you'll grant me rights to use some of your photos for my personal blog, inset inside posts, etc.<br />
# You may link me to some of your coolest photographs.</p>
<p>However, don't be surprised if I don't reply to your email at all. You may try twice but that should be it. As mentioned above, I'll give no reason if I want to accept or reject your request.</p>
