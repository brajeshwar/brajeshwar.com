However, that particular movement in 1857, which also goes by the term "Indian Mutiny" or the "Sepoy Mutiny", really ignited the <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement">Indian independence movement</a> which eventually got its Independence on 15th August, 1947 from the British and foreign rules. The movement involved many political and social organizations and armed and unarmed struggle. Many political ideas also added to the movement.</p>
