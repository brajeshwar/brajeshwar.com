<p>@Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml@</p>
<p>Add that to your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>. That's all you need to tell search engines where your sitemap is located.</p>
<p>Google Blogoscoped <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-04-11-n84.html">says</a>, the big search players Google, Yahoo, Ask and MSN together announced they'll be adding a new way for you to tell them where you store your Sitemap XML file. As <a href="http://sitemaps.org/">Sitemaps.org</a> explains, Sitemaps are a way to tell search engines of your URLs to help their crawlers index them.</p>
