excerpt: The most important new feature added in Leopard is undoubtedly Time Machine,
  Apple's attempt to encourage the vast majority of users who never, ever routinely
  back up their data to change their ways. Time Machine automatically backs up a Mac's
  files to a separate hard drive (internal or external, though external is certainly
  safer and more convenient) or a network volume being shared by another Mac running
  Leopard.

<p>I <a href="http://www.odetoapple.com/2007/mac-os-x-105-leopard/">just upgraded</a> to Apple's latest OS - the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> 10.5 aka Leopard and I'm loving every moment of my new environment. This version is worth the upgrade even with just the Time Machine and of course, there are many other new features and enhancements. Time Machine is one awesome piece of Application and NO Mac user should NOT be NOT using it. Read more of my <a href="http://www.odetoapple.com/2007/mac-os-x-105-leopard/">experience with Leopard</a>.</p>
