excerpt: 'Seriously, ''hasLayout'' can a be way to fix problems in IE 6 and "iExploder"
  7. But triggering this on such a very generic selector as ''ul li'' is pretty dangerous.
  Height [height: 1%] is a "hasLayout" trigger, and giving layout to an "li" causes
  such things as losing the list-marker and other Bad Things (tm) (c) like eating
  goldfishes alive.'

<p>We'll know of many CSS dysfunction in Internet Explorer; even the latest version 7.x release from Microsoft is not spared. <a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html">HasLayout</a> can a be way to fix such CSS dysfunction in both IE 6 and 7. However, an inner Devilish Venom of "hayLayout" is discovered when some IE users of <a href="http://www.letsmint.com/2007/lorem-ipsum-wordpress-theme/">Lorem-Ipsum Wordpress Theme</a> complained about ordered list not being ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Reason</strong>: The Lorem-Ipsum style tries to explore the power of "hasLayout" on a generic selector as simple as "ul li" and that proved pretty dangerous. My bad, I never checked the layout it in IE and was testing them against Firefox, Safari and Opera on the Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Learnt</strong>: Well, look like one do not need to really do a "hasLayout" with generic selector like "ul li" at all.</p>
<p>If you need to know more about His Evil Majesty <a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html">hasLayout</a>, someone wrote an endlessly long, boring and tedious article on the subject. It is only about 45 printed pages long! Blame Chris Wilson, <a href="http://emps.l-c-n.com/">Philippe Wittenbergh</a> for all such an over-sized gem.</p>
