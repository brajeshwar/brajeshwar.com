<p>Adobe released the "Flash Player 9 for Linux (Flash Player 9 for Linux)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2007/01/adobe-flash-player-9-for-linux-released/ 2 days ago. Here are the list of known issues </p>
<p># Full-screen mode and windowless mode are not yet available for the Linux player.<br />
# Express Install is an unsupported feature due to the variety of Linux platforms, each handling the Adobe Flash Player plug-in installation in different ways.<br />
# Modal dialogs displayed by Flash Player stay in front of browser windows but do not prevent interaction with the browser as they should.<br />
# When hovering over Flash content on a web page, the mouse scroll-wheel does not work. Workaround: Hover over the HTML content on the web page.<br />
# On certain SUSE 9.2 installations using the standalone player only, trying to Open a browser from the standalone player with SeaMonkey open will cause the player to hang.<br />
# Networking operations in the standalone player are currently slow.<br />
# When the mouse is hovering over Flash content, keyboard input is not sent to the browser.</p>
