excerpt: If you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the most important thing
  is to quit your day job. Most founders of failed startups don't quit their day jobs,
  and most founders of successful ones do.

<p>Flash/Flex developer, <a href="http://www.orianmarx.com/">Orian Marx</a>, started his Startup with much zeal and enthusiasm but had to give-in to failures because of none other but the team - the founders involved. His article outlined the story so well, it can well serve as a good lesson for everyone involved as co-founders of a startup. It is sad that his startup failed but I appreciate his courage to come out so open with what happened, what he learned and what we can take away from his failure story.</p>
<p>Read his story -- <a href="http://www.orianmarx.com/2008/10/02/reflections-of-a-y-combinator-dropout-introduction/">Reflections of a Y Combinator Dropout</a> -- divided into three parts;</p>
