<p><a href="http://www.jameswhittaker.com/">James Whittaker</a>'s <strong>FreshAIRApps</strong> is not just a website that showcase some of the best and popular Adobe AIR Applications but also provides the community with AIR updates, tutorials and other resources.</p>
<p>The Showcase is the main attraction at <a href="http://freshairapps.com/">FreshAIRApps</a>. It gives a review of an AIR app and allows users to provide opinions in the comments and rate the apps. Users/Visitors can also submit an AIR app for reviewing.</p>
<p>FreshAIRApps is perhaps the first of its kind to concentrate totally on Adobe AIR. It might just prove to be a great resource site for the Adobe AIR developer and designer community.</p>
