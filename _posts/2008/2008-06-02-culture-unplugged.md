<p><em>MTV Exit & Radiohead - <a href="http://www.cultureunplugged.com/documentary/watch-online/play/42/MTV-EXIT---RADIOHEAD---All-I-NEED">All I NEED</a> (Nirmala Nair)</em></p>
<p>They've a special highlight -- MTV EXIT -- a campaign about freedom, about our rights as human beings to choose where we live, where we work, who our friends are, and who we love. Most of us take these freedoms for granted, but hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world have had these basic human rights taken away. They are victims of trafficking - modern-day slaves -- and criminals have forced, defrauded, or coerced them into various forms of labor, or prostitution. MTV EXIT aims to increase awareness and prevention of human trafficking through television programs, online content, live events, and partnerships with anti-trafficking organizations.</p>
