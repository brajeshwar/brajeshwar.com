excerpt: Looking back at the video, there are lot of things that still hold up remarkably
  well in this day and age. A lot of really good work, most of the video is of the
  film festival and award presentations.

<p>A two-hour video footage of FlashForward 2001 (New York). From <a href="http://www.ericd.net/">Eric E. Dolecki</a>.<br />
<hr />
<p>I'm pretty sure this will be one must-watch video for any die-hard Flash fans out there. I downloaded a copy for myself from <a href="http://www.ericd.net/2008/05/found-footage-flashforward-2001-2-hours.html">Eric's</a> website. The original video from Eric is a whooping 295MB which runs for about 2 hours.</p>
