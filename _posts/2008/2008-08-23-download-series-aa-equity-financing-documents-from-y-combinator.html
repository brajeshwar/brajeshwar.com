excerpt: 'These documents were originally created for YC-funded startups to use when
  raising angel rounds. They seem to have worked well in trial runs so far, so YC

<p>Y Combinator and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati announced the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">Series AA Equity Financing Documents</a>. Their goal is to make angel funding rounds for startups easier for both sides.</p>
<p>While they may not be suitable for all situations, the goal is to make the terms fairly neutral. So while it is advisable both parties using these documents to have their lawyers look at them, they provide a starting point that can be used in many situations without too many modifications.</p>
