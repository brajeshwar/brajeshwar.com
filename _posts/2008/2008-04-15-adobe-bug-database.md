excerpt: Beyond its usefulness as a feedback channel for developers, the bug-base
  should be a nice resource for checking on known Flash Player issues and their workarounds.

<p>Saw this off Colin's blog -- <a href="http://www.moock.org/blog/archives/000274.html">Public bug database for flash player</a>.</p>
<p>Adobe got a sparkling new public place to <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/">report and track bug-database</a> for Adobe Softwares and Technologies. In Colin's own words,</p>
<blockquote><p>Beyond its usefulness as a feedback channel for developers, the bugbase should be a nice resource for checking on known issues and their workarounds. The system also gives participants the option to voice support for fixes to existing bugs, which will help Adobe prioritize their engineering efforts based on community feedback.</p></blockquote>
