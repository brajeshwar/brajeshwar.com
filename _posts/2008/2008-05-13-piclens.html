<p>PicLens is a free download that transforms your browser into a full-screen 3D experience for online images and videos. With their recent update, they've included metadata such as image title labels of Flickr photo captions, while you surf through the images.</p>
<p>They've also integrated a new UI, which further streamlines navigation with a more obvious Jump to Page button and an improved full-screen mode. You can get a true full-screen zoom for both images and video (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>) alike.</p>
<p>PicLens is available for Firefox 2.0 and above, Internet Explorer on Windows Vista, XP, and Mac OSX. Download your free copy of <a href="http://www.piclens.com/">PicLens</a>.</p>
