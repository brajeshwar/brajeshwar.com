excerpt: Because, while 40 million US visitors to NBCOlympics didn't have Silverlight
  installed, Adobe Flash is already installed on some 98 percent of Internet-connected
  computers.

<p>The Olympics online were a joint production between NBC and Microsoft, and an opportunity for Microsoft to build a user base for Sillverlight, its new media player. But Flash has a much larger installed base -- it's installed on 98% of Internet-connected desktops, and is pretty much the standard for all mainstream Web video. During the Olympics, 40 million US to visitors NBCOlympics.com didn't yet have Silverlight installed.</p>
<p>However, NBC dumped Silverlight in favor of Flash for live streaming of <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/7/finally-nfl-nbc-to-start-streaming-games-online">Sunday Night Football</a> this fall.
