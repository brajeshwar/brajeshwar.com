excerpt: Badmash is bored. Don't get us wrong. We love us some Bollywood. We couldn't
  help but getting addicted to MTV Roadies. We even admit to curling up with an episode
  of Kaun Banega Crorepati every once in a while.

<p><strong>Dishoom 2008 is about Amitabh as the American Prime Minister candidate.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.velocityig.com/partners/keyur-patel">Keyur Patel</a>, of Velocity Interactive Group, likes giving birth to new companies. His latest kid is a <a href="http://www.badmash.tv/">Badmash</a>, a newly formed pune-based (India) Studio. Sandeep Sood of <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/2008/doubtsourcing/">DoubtSourcing</a>, who thinks brown people are funny, is the head writer at Badmash.</p>
<p>Badmash produces original properties and partners with creative people to develop and distribute content. Their contents are expected to be available in a wide range of formats -- from your iPhone to your HDTV.</p>
<p>They recently launched Dishoom 2008 with a ticklish subject -- Bollywood Badshah, Amitabh Bachchan -- who somehow, got so bored with the American <em>Ishtyle</em> of Politics, decides that he "will be the American Prime Minister."</p>
<p>"But there is no Prime Minister in America!"<br />
"I know! haaahaaa, less competition."</p>
<p><strong>Badmash</strong> is planning to launch other <em>content properties</em> in the next several months, which includes the launch of music and voting on mobile phones in India and a very cool facebook app.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<p>* Badmash is a Hindi (Indian National Language) word synonymous with a crook, a naughty child.<br />
