<p>Mike Chambers of Adobe have announced a new site that he've been working on called <a href="http://www.tostring.org/">tostring.org</a>, which in addition to containing the entire <a href="http://www.tostring.org/books/adobe-air-for-javascript-developers-pocketguide/">Adobe AIR for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide</a> online, also provides an infrastructure for the community to contribute to the books, both through hosting translated versions of the books, as well as allowing comments on individual chapters.</p>
<p>If you're into Adobe AIR, RIAs or the Flash Platform, the site tries to make it easier to reference / search the book content online. If you find an issue, or something isn't clear, Mike encourages its visitors/users to leave a comment on the chapter to clarify or get clarification.</p>
<p>All content on the site is released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, which in essence means that this is the community's site, and the books are the community's books.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.tostring.org/">tostring.org</a>.</p>
