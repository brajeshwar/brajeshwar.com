title: About
---
<p>I was born in a quiet and serene, hill-surrounded green valley of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal">Imphal</a>, Manipur (INDIA) and spent all my childhood-school-life, teenage-college-life there.</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe in simplicity, minimalism, and have an ardent willingness to push the bounds, envisioning the betterment of usable and practical solutions.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Professional Career</h2>
<p>I migrated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay">Bombay</a> in 1999 to kick-start my professional career. Very soon I fell in love with the city, the speed, and the pace at which things get done.</p>
<p>After job-hunting for a month, I landed my first job as a Computer Graphic Designer in a Comic Magazine Startup. As part of the test for the job, I was given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">Floppy-Disk</a> which contains the files to complete a graphic editing task. Without a computer at home, I went about an hour early for the Interview and finished the task at a 'cyber-cafe' nearby. Well, they were impressed with the task and my story on how I completed it. I started work the next week.</p>
<h2>Internet</h2>
<p>It was the Internet boom in India and the proliferation of the Internet was seen prominently. I really wanted to be part of that world. Within 6 months through my first job, I shifted my focus to the Online World - started reading lots of books, online resources and there was no turning back. By mid-2000, I had totally shifted my focus on to the Internet.</p>
<h2>Startup</h2>
<p>In early 2003, I resigned from a very lucrative job and started freelancing full-time. During those freelance days, I did a lot of interesting work and totally enjoyed every moment of it. I learned a lot from those experiences, made lots of friends, and hitch some of the most rewarding relationships.</p>
<p>By 2005, I decided it was time to take the plunge and started our first company - <strong>Oinam Software</strong>. We undertook some of the most innovative, sometimes very experimental work for clients, including but not limited to the likes of <a href="http://www.starz.com/">STARZ</a>, <a href="http://disney.com/">Disney</a>, <a href="http://obeo.com/">Obeo</a>, <a href="http://www.ultrashock.com/">Ultrashock</a>, <a href="http://www.editioninteractive.co.uk/">Edition Interactive</a>, <a href="http://www.cue.org.uk/">Cambridge University Entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="https://www.tcs.com">Tata Consultancy Services</a>. We also worked for many Contractors who sub-contracted their work to us. We were, in fact, one of the best ghost developers to many successful Contractors.</p>
<p>In 2006, our team was acquired to become part of the founding team of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/167518">Mixercast, Inc</a>. It was an exciting experience, being part of a Startup, and learning from it. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixercast">Mixercast</a> was declared dead on December 31, 2009.</p>
<p>In 2007, after spending a year with Mixercast, I started <a href="https://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a>. After 2 years of operation, oCricket was acquired by <a href="https://infinitelybeta.com/">InfinitelyBeta</a> in June 2009. I was involved with the team in the making of the flagship product of Infinitely Beta - Paisa.com.</p>
<p>I continue to leveraging technology in finding solutions to challenges and problems. For details of my professional timeline, view my <a href="https://cv.brajeshwar.com">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p>
